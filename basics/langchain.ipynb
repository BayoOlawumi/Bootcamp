I had\\ntaught it three times and I was getting frustrated. The failure rate in the class was too high\\nand, even for students who succeeded, the overall level of achievement was too low.\\nOne of the problems I saw was the books. They were too big, with too much unnecessary\\ndetail about Java, and not enough high-level guidance about how to program. And they all\\nsuffered from the trap door effect: they would start out easy, proceed gradually, and then\\nsomewhere around Chapter 5 the bottom would fall out. The students would get too much\\nnew material, too fast, and I would spend the rest of the semester picking up the pieces.\\nTwo weeks before the ﬁrst day of classes, I decided to write my own book. My goals were:\\n• Keep it short. It is better for students to read 10 pages than not read 50 pages.\\n• Be careful with vocabulary. I tried to minimize the jargon and deﬁne each term at\\nﬁrst use.\\n• Build gradually. To avoid trap doors, I took the most difﬁcult topics and split them\\ninto a series of small steps.\\n• Focus on programming, not the programming language. I included the minimum\\nuseful subset of Java and left out the rest.\\nI needed a title, so on a whim I chose How to Think Like a Computer Scientist.\\nMy ﬁrst version was rough, but it worked. Students did the reading, and they understood\\nenough that I could spend class time on the hard topics, the interesting topics and (most\\nimportant) letting the students practice.\\nI released the book under the GNU Free Documentation License, which allows users to\\ncopy, modify, and distribute the book.\\nWhat happened next is the cool part. Jeff Elkner, a high school teacher in Virginia, adopted\\nmy book and translated it into Python. He sent me a copy of his translation, and I had the\\nunusual experience of learning Python by reading my own book. As Green Tea Press, I\\npublished the ﬁrst Python version in 2001.\\nIn 2003 I started teaching at Olin College and I got to teach Python for the ﬁrst time. The\\ncontrast with Java was striking. Students struggled less, learned more, worked on more\\ninteresting projects, and generally had a lot more fun.'),\n",

Preface\\nOver the last nine years I continued to develop the book, correcting errors, improving some\\nof the examples and adding material, especially exercises.\\nThe result is this book, now with the less grandiose titleThink Python. Some of the changes\\nare:\\n• I added a section about debugging at the end of each chapter. These sections present\\ngeneral techniques for ﬁnding and avoiding bugs, and warnings about Python pit-\\nfalls.\\n• I added more exercises, ranging from short tests of understanding to a few substantial\\nprojects. And I wrote solutions for most of them.\\n• I added a series of case studies—longer examples with exercises, solutions, and\\ndiscussion. Some are based on Swampy, a suite of Python programs I wrote for\\nuse in my classes. Swampy, code examples, and some solutions are available from\\nhttp://thinkpython.com .\\n• I expanded the discussion of program development plans and basic design patterns.\\n• I added appendices about debugging, analysis of algorithms, and UML diagrams\\nwith Lumpy.\\nI hope you enjoy working with this book, and that it helps you learn to program and think,\\nat least a little bit, like a computer scientist.\\nAllen B.

This way of think-\\ning combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science.\\nLike mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (speciﬁ-\\ncally computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into sys-\\ntems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behav-\\nior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.\\nThe single most important skill for a computer scientist is problem solving. Problem solv-\\ning means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express\\na solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an\\nexcellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills. That’s why this chapter is called,\\n“The way of the program.”\\nOn one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself. On another level, you\\nwill use programming as a means to an end. As we go along, that end will become clearer.\\n1.1 The Python programming language\\nThe programming language you will learn is Python. Python is an example of ahigh-level\\nlanguage; other high-level languages you might have heard of are C, C++, Perl, and Java.\\nThere are also low-level languages, sometimes referred to as “machine languages” or “as-\\nsembly languages.” Loosely speaking, computers can only run programs written in low-\\nlevel languages. So programs written in a high-level language have to be processed before\\nthey can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of\\nhigh-level languages.\\nThe advantages are enormous. First, it is much easier to program in a high-level language.\\nPrograms written in a high-level language take less time to write, they are shorter and\\neasier to read, and they are more likely to be correct. Second, high-level languages are\\nportable, meaning that they can run on different kinds of computers with few or no modi-\\nﬁcations. Low-level programs can run on only one kind of computer and have to be rewrit-\\nten to run on another.'),\n",

Low-\\nlevel languages are used only for a few specialized applications.\\nTwo kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages:interpreters\\nand compilers. An interpreter reads a high-level program and executes it, meaning that it\\ndoes what the program says. It processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading\\nlines and performing computations. Figure 1.1 shows the structure of an interpreter.\\nA compiler reads the program and translates it completely before the program starts run-\\nning. In this context, the high-level program is called the source code, and the translated\\nprogram is called the object code or the executable. Once a program is compiled, you\\ncan execute it repeatedly without further translation. Figure 1.2 shows the structure of a\\ncompiler.\\nPython is considered an interpreted language because Python programs are executed by an\\ninterpreter. There are two ways to use the interpreter: interactive mode and script mode.\\nIn interactive mode, you type Python programs and the interpreter displays the result:\\n>>> 1 + 1\\n2\\nThe chevron, >>> , is the prompt the interpreter uses to indicate that it is ready. If you type\\n1 + 1 , the interpreter replies 2 .\\nAlternatively, you can store code in a ﬁle and use the interpreter to execute the contents of\\nthe ﬁle, which is called a script. By convention, Python scripts have names that end with\\n.py .\\nTo execute the script, you have to tell the interpreter the name of the ﬁle. If you have a\\nscript named dinsdale.py and you are working in a UNIX command window, you type\\npython dinsdale.py . In other development environments, the details of executing scripts\\nare different. You can ﬁnd instructions for your environment at the Python website http:\\n//python.org .\\nWorking in interactive mode is convenient for testing small pieces of code because you can\\ntype and execute them immediately. But for anything more than a few lines, you should\\nsave your code as a script so you can modify and execute it in the future.'),\n",

What is a program? 3\\n1.2 What is a program?\\nA program is a sequence of instructions that speciﬁes how to perform a computation. The\\ncomputation might be something mathematical, such as solving a system of equations or\\nﬁnding the roots of a polynomial, but it can also be a symbolic computation, such as search-\\ning and replacing text in a document or (strangely enough) compiling a program.\\nThe details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just\\nabout every language:\\ninput: Get data from the keyboard, a ﬁle, or some other device.\\noutput: Display data on the screen or send data to a ﬁle or other device.\\nmath: Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication.\\nconditional execution: Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate code.\\nrepetition: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.\\nBelieve it or not, that’s pretty much all there is to it. Every program you’ve ever used,\\nno matter how complicated, is made up of instructions that look pretty much like these.\\nSo you can think of programming as the process of breaking a large, complex task into\\nsmaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with\\none of these basic instructions.\\nThat may be a little vague, but we will come back to this topic when we talk about algo-\\nrithms.\\n1.3 What is debugging?\\nProgramming is error-prone. For whimsical reasons, programming errors are called bugs\\nand the process of tracking them down is called debugging.\\nThree kinds of errors can occur in a program: syntax errors, runtime errors, and semantic\\nerrors. It is useful to distinguish between them in order to track them down more quickly.\\n1.3.1 Syntax errors\\nPython can only execute a program if the syntax is correct; otherwise, the interpreter dis-\\nplays an error message. Syntax refers to the structure of a program and the rules about that\\nstructure. For example, parentheses have to come in matching pairs, so (1 + 2) is legal,\\nbut 8) is a syntax error.\\nIn English, readers can tolerate most syntax errors, which is why we can read the poetry\\nof e. e. cummings without spewing error messages. Python is not so forgiving. If there\\nis a single syntax error anywhere in your program, Python will display an error message\\nand quit, and you will not be able to run your program. During the ﬁrst few weeks of your\\nprogramming career, you will probably spend a lot of time tracking down syntax errors.\\nAs you gain experience, you will make fewer errors and ﬁnd them faster.'),\n",

The way of the program\\n1.3.2 Runtime errors\\nThe second type of error is a runtime error, so called because the error does not appear until\\nafter the program has started running. These errors are also calledexceptions because they\\nusually indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened.\\nRuntime errors are rare in the simple programs you will see in the ﬁrst few chapters, so it\\nmight be a while before you encounter one.\\n1.3.3 Semantic errors\\nThe third type of error is thesemantic error. If there is a semantic error in your program, it\\nwill run successfully in the sense that the computer will not generate any error messages,\\nbut it will not do the right thing. It will do something else. Speciﬁcally, it will do what you\\ntold it to do.\\nThe problem is that the program you wrote is not the program you wanted to write. The\\nmeaning of the program (its semantics) is wrong. Identifying semantic errors can be tricky\\nbecause it requires you to work backward by looking at the output of the program and\\ntrying to ﬁgure out what it is doing.\\n1.3.4 Experimental debugging\\nOne of the most important skills you will acquire is debugging. Although it can be frus-\\ntrating, debugging is one of the most intellectually rich, challenging, and interesting parts\\nof programming.\\nIn some ways, debugging is like detective work. You are confronted with clues, and you\\nhave to infer the processes and events that led to the results you see.\\nDebugging is also like an experimental science. Once you have an idea about what is going\\nwrong, you modify your program and try again. If your hypothesis was correct, then you\\ncan predict the result of the modiﬁcation, and you take a step closer to a working program.\\nIf your hypothesis was wrong, you have to come up with a new one. As Sherlock Holmes\\npointed out, “When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however im-\\nprobable, must be the truth.” (A. Conan Doyle, The Sign of Four)\\nFor some people, programming and debugging are the same thing. That is, programming\\nis the process of gradually debugging a program until it does what you want. The idea is\\nthat you should start with a program that does something and make small modiﬁcations,\\ndebugging them as you go, so that you always have a working program.\\nFor example, Linux is an operating system that contains thousands of lines of code, but\\nit started out as a simple program Linus Torvalds used to explore the Intel 80386 chip.\\nAccording to Larry Greenﬁeld, “One of Linus’s earlier projects was a program that would\\nswitch between printing AAAA and BBBB. This later evolved to Linux.” ( The Linux Users’\\nGuide Beta Version 1).\\nLater chapters will make more suggestions about debugging and other programming prac-\\ntices.'),\n",

Formal and natural languages 5\\n1.4 Formal and natural languages\\nNatural languages are the languages people speak, such as English, Spanish, and French.\\nThey were not designed by people (although people try to impose some order on them);\\nthey evolved naturally.\\nFormal languages are languages that are designed by people for speciﬁc applications. For\\nexample, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly\\ngood at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols. Chemists use a formal lan-\\nguage to represent the chemical structure of molecules. And most importantly:\\nProgramming languages are formal languages that have been designed to\\nexpress computations.\\nFormal languages tend to have strict rules about syntax. For example, 3 + 3 = 6 is a\\nsyntactically correct mathematical statement, but 3 + = 3$6 is not. H2O is a syntactically\\ncorrect chemical formula, but 2Zz is not.\\nSyntax rules come in two ﬂavors, pertaining to tokens and structure. Tokens are the basic\\nelements of the language, such as words, numbers, and chemical elements. One of the\\nproblems with 3 + = 3$6 is that $ is not a legal token in mathematics (at least as far as I\\nknow). Similarly, 2Zz is not legal because there is no element with the abbreviation Zz.\\nThe second type of syntax rule pertains to the structure of a statement; that is, the way the\\ntokens are arranged. The statement 3 + = 3 is illegal because even though + and = are\\nlegal tokens, you can’t have one right after the other. Similarly, in a chemical formula the\\nsubscript comes after the element name, not before.\\nExercise 1.1. Write a well-structured English sentence with invalid tokens in it. Then write an-\\nother sentence with all valid tokens but with invalid structure.\\nWhen you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal language, you have to\\nﬁgure out what the structure of the sentence is (although in a natural language you do this\\nsubconsciously). This process is called parsing.\\nFor example, when you hear the sentence, “The penny dropped,” you understand that\\n“the penny” is the subject and “dropped” is the predicate. Once you have parsed a sen-\\ntence, you can ﬁgure out what it means, or the semantics of the sentence. Assuming that\\nyou know what a penny is and what it means to drop, you will understand the general\\nimplication of this sentence.\\nAlthough formal and natural languages have many features in common—tokens, struc-\\nture, syntax, and semantics—there are some differences:\\nambiguity: Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which people deal with by using con-\\ntextual clues and other information. Formal languages are designed to be nearly or\\ncompletely unambiguous, which means that any statement has exactly one meaning,\\nregardless of context.\\nredundancy: In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce misunderstandings, natural\\nlanguages employ lots of redundancy. As a result, they are often verbose. Formal\\nlanguages are less redundant and more concise.'),\n",

The way of the program\\nliteralness: Natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor. If I say, “The penny\\ndropped,” there is probably no penny and nothing dropping (this idiom means that\\nsomeone realized something after a period of confusion). Formal languages mean\\nexactly what they say.\\nPeople who grow up speaking a natural language—everyone—often have a hard time ad-\\njusting to formal languages. In some ways, the difference between formal and natural\\nlanguage is like the difference between poetry and prose, but more so:\\nPoetry: Words are used for their sounds as well as for their meaning, and the whole poem\\ntogether creates an effect or emotional response. Ambiguity is not only common but\\noften deliberate.\\nProse: The literal meaning of words is more important, and the structure contributes more\\nmeaning. Prose is more amenable to analysis than poetry but still often ambiguous.\\nPrograms: The meaning of a computer program is unambiguous and literal, and can be\\nunderstood entirely by analysis of the tokens and structure.\\nHere are some suggestions for reading programs (and other formal languages). First, re-\\nmember that formal languages are much more dense than natural languages, so it takes\\nlonger to read them. Also, the structure is very important, so it is usually not a good idea\\nto read from top to bottom, left to right. Instead, learn to parse the program in your head,\\nidentifying the tokens and interpreting the structure. Finally, the details matter. Small er-\\nrors in spelling and punctuation, which you can get away with in natural languages, can\\nmake a big difference in a formal language.\\n1.5 The ﬁrst program\\nTraditionally, the ﬁrst program you write in a new language is called “Hello, World!” be-\\ncause all it does is display the words “Hello, World!”. In Python, it looks like this:\\nprint ' Hello, World! '\\nThis is an example of a print statement, which doesn’t actually print anything on paper. It\\ndisplays a value on the screen. In this case, the result is the words\\nHello, World!\\nThe quotation marks in the program mark the beginning and end of the text to be dis-\\nplayed; they don’t appear in the result.\\nIn Python 3, the syntax for printing is slightly different:\\nprint( ' Hello, World! ' )\\nThe parentheses indicate that print is a function. We’ll get to functions in Chapter 3.\\nFor the rest of this book, I’ll use the print statement. If you are using Python 3, you will\\nhave to translate. But other than that, there are very few differences we have to worry\\nabout.\"),\n",

You can run most of the examples in interactive mode, but if you put the code in a\\nscript, it is easier to try out variations.\\nWhenever you are experimenting with a new feature, you should try to make mistakes.\\nFor example, in the “Hello, world!” program, what happens if you leave out one of the\\nquotation marks? What if you leave out both? What if you spell print wrong?\\nThis kind of experiment helps you remember what you read; it also helps with debugging,\\nbecause you get to know what the error messages mean. It is better to make mistakes now\\nand on purpose than later and accidentally.\\nProgramming, and especially debugging, sometimes brings out strong emotions.

One approach is to think of\\nthe computer as an employee with certain strengths, like speed and precision, and partic-\\nular weaknesses, like lack of empathy and inability to grasp the big picture.\\nYour job is to be a good manager: ﬁnd ways to take advantage of the strengths and mitigate\\nthe weaknesses. And ﬁnd ways to use your emotions to engage with the problem, without\\nletting your reactions interfere with your ability to work effectively.\\nLearning to debug can be frustrating, but it is a valuable skill that is useful for many ac-\\ntivities beyond programming.

But there are differences between\\ninteractive mode and script mode that can be confusing.\\nFor example, if you are using Python as a calculator, you might type\\n>>> miles = 26.2\\n>>> miles * 1.61\\n42.182\\nThe ﬁrst line assigns a value to miles , but it has no visible effect. The second line is an ex-\\npression, so the interpreter evaluates it and displays the result. So we learn that a marathon\\nis about 42 kilometers.\\nBut if you type the same code into a script and run it, you get no output at all. In script\\nmode an expression, all by itself, has no visible effect. Python actually evaluates the ex-\\npression, but it doesn’t display the value unless you tell it to:\\nmiles = 26.2\\nprint miles * 1.61\\nThis behavior can be confusing at ﬁrst.\\nA script usually contains a sequence of statements.

Modify the script by\\ntransforming each expression into a print statement and then run it again.\\n2.7 Order of operations\\nWhen more than one operator appears in an expression, the order of evaluation depends\\non the rules of precedence . For mathematical operators, Python follows mathematical\\nconvention. The acronym PEMDAS is a useful way to remember the rules:\\n• Parentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression to\\nevaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in parentheses are evaluated ﬁrst,\\n2 * (3-1) is 4, and (1+1)**(5-2) is 8. You can also use parentheses to make an\\nexpression easier to read, as in (minute * 100) / 60 , even if it doesn’t change the\\nresult.\\n• Exponentiation has the next highest precedence, so 2**1+1 is 3, not 4, and 3*1**3 is\\n3, not 27.\\n• Multiplication and Division have the same precedence, which is higher than\\nAddition and Subtraction, which also have the same precedence. So 2*3-1 is 5, not\\n4, and 6+4/2 is 8, not 5.\\n• Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right (except exponen-\\ntiation). So in the expression degrees / 2 * pi , the division happens ﬁrst and the\\nresult is multiplied by pi . To divide by 2π, you can use parentheses or writedegrees\\n/ 2 / pi .\\nI don’t work very hard to remember rules of precedence for other operators. If I can’t tell\\nby looking at the expression, I use parentheses to make it obvious.\\n2.8 String operations\\nIn general, you can’t perform mathematical operations on strings, even if the strings look\\nlike numbers, so the following are illegal:\\n' 2 ' - ' 1 ' ' eggs ' / ' easy ' ' third ' * ' a charm '\"),\n",

Variables, expressions and statements\\nThe + operator works with strings, but it might not do what you expect: it performs con-\\ncatenation, which means joining the strings by linking them end-to-end. For example:\\nfirst = ' throat '\\nsecond = ' warbler '\\nprint first + second\\nThe output of this program is throatwarbler .\\nThe * operator also works on strings; it performs repetition. For example, ' Spam ' *3 is\\n' SpamSpamSpam ' . If one of the operands is a string, the other has to be an integer.\\nThis use of + and * makes sense by analogy with addition and multiplication. Just as 4*3\\nis equivalent to 4+4+4 , we expect ' Spam ' *3 to be the same as ' Spam ' + ' Spam ' + ' Spam ' , and\\nit is. On the other hand, there is a signiﬁcant way in which string concatenation and repe-\\ntition are different from integer addition and multiplication. Can you think of a property\\nthat addition has that string concatenation does not?\\n2.9 Comments\\nAs programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difﬁcult to read. Formal\\nlanguages are dense, and it is often difﬁcult to look at a piece of code and ﬁgure out what\\nit is doing, or why.\\nFor this reason, it is a good idea to add notes to your programs to explain in natural lan-\\nguage what the program is doing.

A\\nmodule is a ﬁle that contains a collection of related functions.\\nBefore we can use the module, we have to import it:\\n>>> import math\\nThis statement creates a module object named math. If you print the module object, you\\nget some information about it:\\n>>> print math\\n<module ' math ' (built-in)>\\nThe module object contains the functions and variables deﬁned in the module. To access\\none of the functions, you have to specify the name of the module and the name of the\\nfunction, separated by a dot (also known as a period). This format is called dot notation.\\n>>> ratio = signal_power / noise_power\\n>>> decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio)\\n>>> radians = 0.7\\n>>> height = math.sin(radians)\\nThe ﬁrst example uses log10 to compute a signal-to-noise ratio in decibels (assuming that\\nsignal_power and noise_power are deﬁned). The math module also provides log , which\\ncomputes logarithms base e .\\nThe second example ﬁnds the sine of radians . The name of the variable is a hint that sin\\nand the other trigonometric functions (cos , tan , etc.) take arguments in radians. To convert\\nfrom degrees to radians, divide by 360 and multiply by 2π:\\n>>> degrees = 45\\n>>> radians = degrees / 360.0 * 2 * math.pi\\n>>> math.sin(radians)\\n0.707106781187\\nThe expression math.pi gets the variable pi from the math module. The value of this\\nvariable is an approximation of π, accurate to about 15 digits.\\nIf you know your trigonometry, you can check the previous result by comparing it to the\\nsquare root of two divided by two:\\n>>> math.sqrt(2) / 2.0\\n0.707106781187\"),\n",

Composition 21\\n3.4 Composition\\nSo far, we have looked at the elements of a program—variables, expressions, and\\nstatements—in isolation, without talking about how to combine them.\\nOne of the most useful features of programming languages is their ability to take small\\nbuilding blocks and compose them. For example, the argument of a function can be any\\nkind of expression, including arithmetic operators:\\nx = math.sin(degrees / 360.0 * 2 * math.pi)\\nAnd even function calls:\\nx = math.exp(math.log(x+1))\\nAlmost anywhere you can put a value, you can put an arbitrary expression, with one ex-\\nception: the left side of an assignment statement has to be a variable name. Any other\\nexpression on the left side is a syntax error (we will see exceptions to this rule later).\\n>>> minutes = hours * 60 # right\\n>>> hours * 60 = minutes # wrong!\\nSyntaxError: can \\' t assign to operator\\n3.5 Adding new functions\\nSo far, we have only been using the functions that come with Python, but it is also possible\\nto add new functions. A function deﬁnition speciﬁes the name of a new function and the\\nsequence of statements that execute when the function is called.\\nHere is an example:\\ndef print_lyrics():\\nprint \"I \\' m a lumberjack, and I \\' m okay.\"\\nprint \"I sleep all night and I work all day.\"\\ndef is a keyword that indicates that this is a function deﬁnition. The name of the function\\nis print_lyrics . The rules for function names are the same as for variable names: letters,\\nnumbers and some punctuation marks are legal, but the ﬁrst character can’t be a number.\\nYou can’t use a keyword as the name of a function, and you should avoid having a variable\\nand a function with the same name.\\nThe empty parentheses after the name indicate that this function doesn’t take any argu-\\nments.\\nThe ﬁrst line of the function deﬁnition is called the header; the rest is called the body.\\nThe header has to end with a colon and the body has to be indented. By convention, the\\nindentation is always four spaces (see Section 3.14). The body can contain any number of\\nstatements.\\nThe strings in the print statements are enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes and double\\nquotes do the same thing; most people use single quotes except in cases like this where a\\nsingle quote (which is also an apostrophe) appears in the string.\\nIf you type a function deﬁnition in interactive mode, the interpreter prints ellipses ( ...) to\\nlet you know that the deﬁnition isn’t complete:'),\n",

Flow of execution 23\\nAs you might expect, you have to create a function before you can execute it. In other\\nwords, the function deﬁnition has to be executed before the ﬁrst time it is called.\\nExercise 3.1. Move the last line of this program to the top, so the function call appears before the\\ndeﬁnitions. Run the program and see what error message you get.\\nExercise 3.2. Move the function call back to the bottom and move the deﬁnition of print_lyrics\\nafter the deﬁnition of repeat_lyrics . What happens when you run this program?\\n3.7 Flow of execution\\nIn order to ensure that a function is deﬁned before its ﬁrst use, you have to know the order\\nin which statements are executed, which is called the ﬂow of execution.\\nExecution always begins at the ﬁrst statement of the program. Statements are executed one\\nat a time, in order from top to bottom.\\nFunction deﬁnitions do not alter the ﬂow of execution of the program, but remember that\\nstatements inside the function are not executed until the function is called.\\nA function call is like a detour in the ﬂow of execution. Instead of going to the next state-\\nment, the ﬂow jumps to the body of the function, executes all the statements there, and\\nthen comes back to pick up where it left off.\\nThat sounds simple enough, until you remember that one function can call another. While\\nin the middle of one function, the program might have to execute the statements in another\\nfunction. But while executing that new function, the program might have to execute yet\\nanother function!\\nFortunately, Python is good at keeping track of where it is, so each time a function com-\\npletes, the program picks up where it left off in the function that called it. When it gets to\\nthe end of the program, it terminates.\\nWhat’s the moral of this sordid tale? When you read a program, you don’t always want\\nto read from top to bottom. Sometimes it makes more sense if you follow the ﬂow of\\nexecution.\\n3.8 Parameters and arguments\\nSome of the built-in functions we have seen require arguments. For example, when you\\ncall math.sin you pass a number as an argument. Some functions take more than one\\nargument: math.pow takes two, the base and the exponent.\\nInside the function, the arguments are assigned to variables called parameters. Here is an\\nexample of a user-deﬁned function that takes an argument:\\ndef print_twice(bruce):\\nprint bruce\\nprint bruce\\nThis function assigns the argument to a parameter named bruce . When the function is\\ncalled, it prints the value of the parameter (whatever it is) twice.\\nThis function works with any value that can be printed.'),\n",

Like state diagrams, stack diagrams show the value of each variable, but they\\nalso show the function each variable belongs to.\\nEach function is represented by a frame. A frame is a box with the name of a function\\nbeside it and the parameters and variables of the function inside it. The stack diagram for\\nthe previous example is shown in Figure 3.1.\\nThe frames are arranged in a stack that indicates which function called which, and so\\non. In this example, print_twice was called by cat_twice , and cat_twice was called\\nby __main__ , which is a special name for the topmost frame. When you create a variable\\noutside of any function, it belongs to __main__ .\\nEach parameter refers to the same value as its corresponding argument. So, part1 has the\\nsame value as line1 , part2 has the same value as line2 , and bruce has the same value as\\ncat .\\nIf an error occurs during a function call, Python prints the name of the function, and the\\nname of the function that called it, and the name of the function that calledthat, all the way\\nback to __main__ .\\nFor example, if you try to access cat from within print_twice , you get a NameError :\\nTraceback (innermost last):\\nFile \"test.py\", line 13, in __main__\\ncat_twice(line1, line2)\\nFile \"test.py\", line 5, in cat_twice\\nprint_twice(cat)\\nFile \"test.py\", line 9, in print_twice\\nprint cat\\nNameError: name \\' cat \\' is not defined\\nThis list of functions is called a traceback. It tells you what program ﬁle the error occurred\\nin, and what line, and what functions were executing at the time. It also shows the line of\\ncode that caused the error.'),\n",

The function that is currently running is at the bottom.\\n3.11 Fruitful functions and void functions\\nSome of the functions we are using, such as the math functions, yield results; for lack of a\\nbetter name, I call them fruitful functions. Other functions, like print_twice , perform an\\naction but don’t return a value. They are calledvoid functions.\\nWhen you call a fruitful function, you almost always want to do something with the result;\\nfor example, you might assign it to a variable or use it as part of an expression:\\nx = math.cos(radians)\\ngolden = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2\\nWhen you call a function in interactive mode, Python displays the result:\\n>>> math.sqrt(5)\\n2.2360679774997898\\nBut in a script, if you call a fruitful function all by itself, the return value is lost forever!\\nmath.sqrt(5)\\nThis script computes the square root of 5, but since it doesn’t store or display the result, it\\nis not very useful.\\nVoid functions might display something on the screen or have some other effect, but they\\ndon’t have a return value. If you try to assign the result to a variable, you get a special\\nvalue called None .\\n>>> result = print_twice( ' Bing ' )\\nBing\\nBing\\n>>> print result\\nNone\\nThe value None is not the same as the string ' None ' . It is a special value that has its own\\ntype:\\n>>> print type(None)\\n<type ' NoneType ' >\\nThe functions we have written so far are all void. We will start writing fruitful functions in\\na few chapters.\\n3.12 Why functions?\\nIt may not be clear why it is worth the trouble to divide a program into functions.

Importing with from 27\\n• Dividing a long program into functions allows you to debug the parts one at a time\\nand then assemble them into a working whole.\\n• Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you write and\\ndebug one, you can reuse it.\\n3.13 Importing with from\\nPython provides two ways to import modules; we have already seen one:\\n>>> import math\\n>>> print math\\n<module \\' math \\' (built-in)>\\n>>> print math.pi\\n3.14159265359\\nIf you import math , you get a module object named math . The module object contains\\nconstants like pi and functions like sin and exp .\\nBut if you try to access pi directly, you get an error.\\n>>> print pi\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\nNameError: name \\' pi \\' is not defined\\nAs an alternative, you can import an object from a module like this:\\n>>> from math import pi\\nNow you can access pi directly, without dot notation.\\n>>> print pi\\n3.14159265359\\nOr you can use the star operator to import everything from the module:\\n>>> from math import *\\n>>> cos(pi)\\n-1.0\\nThe advantage of importing everything from the math module is that your code can be\\nmore concise. The disadvantage is that there might be conﬂicts between names deﬁned in\\ndifferent modules, or between a name from a module and one of your variables.\\n3.14 Debugging\\nIf you are using a text editor to write your scripts, you might run into problems with spaces\\nand tabs. The best way to avoid these problems is to use spaces exclusively (no tabs). Most\\ntext editors that know about Python do this by default, but some don’t.\\nTabs and spaces are usually invisible, which makes them hard to debug, so try to ﬁnd an\\neditor that manages indentation for you.\\nAlso, don’t forget to save your program before you run it. Some development environ-\\nments do this automatically, but some don’t. In that case the program you are looking at in\\nthe text editor is not the same as the program you are running.'),\n",

Don’t go on until you do.\\nHere is a for statement that draws a square:\\nfor i in range(4):\\nfd(bob, 100)\\nlt(bob)\\nThe syntax of a for statement is similar to a function deﬁnition. It has a header that ends\\nwith a colon and an indented body. The body can contain any number of statements.\\nA for statement is sometimes called a loop because the ﬂow of execution runs through the\\nbody and then loops back to the top. In this case, it runs the body four times.\\nThis version is actually a little different from the previous square-drawing code because it\\nmakes another turn after drawing the last side of the square. The extra turn takes a little\\nmore time, but it simpliﬁes the code if we do the same thing every time through the loop.\\nThis version also has the effect of leaving the turtle back in the starting position, facing in\\nthe starting direction.\\n4.3 Exercises\\nThe following is a series of exercises using TurtleWorld. They are meant to be fun, but they\\nhave a point, too. While you are working on them, think about what the point is.\\nThe following sections have solutions to the exercises, so don’t look until you have ﬁnished\\n(or at least tried).\\n1. Write a function called square that takes a parameter named t , which is a turtle. It\\nshould use the turtle to draw a square.\\nWrite a function call that passes bob as an argument to square , and then run the\\nprogram again.\\n2. Add another parameter, named length , to square . Modify the body so length of the\\nsides is length , and then modify the function call to provide a second argument. Run\\nthe program again. Test your program with a range of values for length .\\n3. The functions lt and rt make 90-degree turns by default, but you can provide a\\nsecond argument that speciﬁes the number of degrees. For example, lt(bob, 45)\\nturns bob 45 degrees to the left.\\nMake a copy of square and change the name to polygon . Add another parameter\\nnamed n and modify the body so it draws an n-sided regular polygon. Hint: The\\nexterior angles of an n-sided regular polygon are 360/n degrees.\\n4. Write a function called circle that takes a turtle, t , and radius, r , as parameters and\\nthat draws an approximate circle by invoking polygon with an appropriate length\\nand number of sides.

Make a more general version of circle called arc that takes an additional parameter\\nangle , which determines what fraction of a circle to draw.angle is in units of degrees,\\nso when angle=360 , arc should draw a complete circle.\\n4.4 Encapsulation\\nThe ﬁrst exercise asks you to put your square-drawing code into a function deﬁnition and\\nthen call the function, passing the turtle as a parameter. Here is a solution:\\ndef square(t):\\nfor i in range(4):\\nfd(t, 100)\\nlt(t)\\nsquare(bob)\\nThe innermost statements, fd and lt are indented twice to show that they are inside the\\nfor loop, which is inside the function deﬁnition. The next line, square(bob) , is ﬂush with\\nthe left margin, so that is the end of both the for loop and the function deﬁnition.\\nInside the function, t refers to the same turtle bob refers to, so lt(t) has the same effect as\\nlt(bob) . So why not call the parameter bob ? The idea is that t can be any turtle, not just\\nbob , so you could create a second turtle and pass it as an argument to square :\\nray = Turtle()\\nsquare(ray)\\nWrapping a piece of code up in a function is called encapsulation. One of the beneﬁts of\\nencapsulation is that it attaches a name to the code, which serves as a kind of documenta-\\ntion. Another advantage is that if you re-use the code, it is more concise to call a function\\ntwice than to copy and paste the body!\\n4.5 Generalization\\nThe next step is to add a length parameter to square . Here is a solution:\\ndef square(t, length):\\nfor i in range(4):\\nfd(t, length)\\nlt(t)\\nsquare(bob, 100)\\nAdding a parameter to a function is called generalization because it makes the function\\nmore general: in the previous version, the square is always the same size; in this version it\\ncan be any size.'),\n",

Interface design 35\\nThe next step is also a generalization. Instead of drawing squares, polygon draws regular\\npolygons with any number of sides. Here is a solution :rule\\ndef polygon(t, n, length):\\nangle = 360.0 / n\\nfor i in range(n):\\nfd(t, length)\\nlt(t, angle)\\npolygon(bob, 7, 70)\\nThis draws a 7-sided polygon with side length 70. If you have more than a few numeric\\narguments, it is easy to forget what they are, or what order they should be in. It is legal,\\nand sometimes helpful, to include the names of the parameters in the argument list:\\npolygon(bob, n=7, length=70)\\nThese are called keyword arguments because they include the parameter names as “key-\\nwords” (not to be confused with Python keywords like while and def ).\\nThis syntax makes the program more readable. It is also a reminder about how arguments\\nand parameters work: when you call a function, the arguments are assigned to the param-\\neters.\\n4.6 Interface design\\nThe next step is to write circle , which takes a radius, r , as a parameter. Here is a simple\\nsolution that uses polygon to draw a 50-sided polygon:\\ndef circle(t, r):\\ncircumference = 2 * math.pi * r\\nn = 50\\nlength = circumference / n\\npolygon(t, n, length)\\nThe ﬁrst line computes the circumference of a circle with radius r using the formula 2 πr.\\nSince we use math.pi , we have to import math . By convention, import statements are\\nusually at the beginning of the script.\\nn is the number of line segments in our approximation of a circle, so length is the length\\nof each segment. Thus, polygon draws a 50-sides polygon that approximates a circle with\\nradius r .\\nOne limitation of this solution is that n is a constant, which means that for very big circles,\\nthe line segments are too long, and for small circles, we waste time drawing very small\\nsegments. One solution would be to generalize the function by taking n as a parameter.\\nThis would give the user (whoever calls circle ) more control, but the interface would be\\nless clean.\\nThe interface of a function is a summary of how it is used: what are the parameters? What\\ndoes the function do? And what is the return value? An interface is “clean” if it is “as\\nsimple as possible, but not simpler. (Einstein)”\\nIn this example, r belongs in the interface because it speciﬁes the circle to be drawn. n is\\nless appropriate because it pertains to the details of how the circle should be rendered.'),\n",

But arc is not as cooperative; we can’t usepolygon or circle to\\ndraw an arc.\\nOne alternative is to start with a copy of polygon and transform it into arc . The result\\nmight look like this:\\ndef arc(t, r, angle):\\narc_length = 2 * math.pi * r * angle / 360\\nn = int(arc_length / 3) + 1\\nstep_length = arc_length / n\\nstep_angle = float(angle) / n\\nfor i in range(n):\\nfd(t, step_length)\\nlt(t, step_angle)\\nThe second half of this function looks like polygon , but we can’t re-use polygon without\\nchanging the interface. We could generalize polygon to take an angle as a third argument,\\nbut then polygon would no longer be an appropriate name! Instead, let’s call the more\\ngeneral function polyline :\\ndef polyline(t, n, length, angle):\\nfor i in range(n):\\nfd(t, length)\\nlt(t, angle)\\nNow we can rewrite polygon and arc to use polyline :\\ndef polygon(t, n, length):\\nangle = 360.0 / n\\npolyline(t, n, length, angle)\\ndef arc(t, r, angle):\\narc_length = 2 * math.pi * r * angle / 360\\nn = int(arc_length / 3) + 1\\nstep_length = arc_length / n\\nstep_angle = float(angle) / n\\npolyline(t, n, step_length, step_angle)'),\n",

In this case, we noticed that there was similar code in arc and\\npolygon , so we “factored it out” into polyline .\\nIf we had planned ahead, we might have written polyline ﬁrst and avoided refactoring,\\nbut often you don’t know enough at the beginning of a project to design all the interfaces.\\nOnce you start coding, you understand the problem better. Sometimes refactoring is a sign\\nthat you have learned something.\\n4.8 A development plan\\nA development plan is a process for writing programs. The process we used in this case\\nstudy is “encapsulation and generalization.” The steps of this process are:\\n1. Start by writing a small program with no function deﬁnitions.\\n2. Once you get the program working, encapsulate it in a function and give it a name.\\n3. Generalize the function by adding appropriate parameters.\\n4. Repeat steps 1–3 until you have a set of working functions. Copy and paste working\\ncode to avoid retyping (and re-debugging).\\n5. Look for opportunities to improve the program by refactoring. For example, if you\\nhave similar code in several places, consider factoring it into an appropriately general\\nfunction.\\nThis process has some drawbacks—we will see alternatives later—but it can be useful if\\nyou don’t know ahead of time how to divide the program into functions. This approach\\nlets you design as you go along.\\n4.9 docstring\\nA docstring is a string at the beginning of a function that explains the interface (“doc” is\\nshort for “documentation”). Here is an example:\\ndef polyline(t, n, length, angle):\\n\"\"\"Draws n line segments with the given length and\\nangle (in degrees) between them. t is a turtle.\\n\"\"\"\\nfor i in range(n):\\nfd(t, length)\\nlt(t, angle)'),\n",

Case study: interface design\\nThis docstring is a triple-quoted string, also known as a multiline string because the triple\\nquotes allow the string to span more than one line.\\nIt is terse, but it contains the essential information someone would need to use this func-\\ntion. It explains concisely what the function does (without getting into the details of how\\nit does it). It explains what effect each parameter has on the behavior of the function and\\nwhat type each parameter should be (if it is not obvious).\\nWriting this kind of documentation is an important part of interface design. A well-\\ndesigned interface should be simple to explain; if you are having a hard time explaining\\none of your functions, that might be a sign that the interface could be improved.\\n4.10 Debugging\\nAn interface is like a contract between a function and a caller. The caller agrees to provide\\ncertain parameters and the function agrees to do certain work.\\nFor example, polyline requires four arguments: t has to be a Turtle; n is the number of\\nline segments, so it has to be an integer; length should be a positive number; and angle\\nhas to be a number, which is understood to be in degrees.\\nThese requirements are called preconditions because they are supposed to be true before\\nthe function starts executing. Conversely, conditions at the end of the function are post-\\nconditions. Postconditions include the intended effect of the function (like drawing line\\nsegments) and any side effects (like moving the Turtle or making other changes in the\\nWorld).\\nPreconditions are the responsibility of the caller. If the caller violates a (properly docu-\\nmented!) precondition and the function doesn’t work correctly, the bug is in the caller, not\\nthe function.\\n4.11 Glossary\\ninstance: A member of a set.

In Python, the modulus operator is a percent sign (% ). The syntax\\nis the same as for other operators:\\n>>> quotient = 7 / 3\\n>>> print quotient\\n2\\n>>> remainder = 7 % 3\\n>>> print remainder\\n1\\nSo 7 divided by 3 is 2 with 1 left over.\\nThe modulus operator turns out to be surprisingly useful. For example, you can check\\nwhether one number is divisible by another—if x % y is zero, then x is divisible by y .\\nAlso, you can extract the right-most digit or digits from a number. For example, x % 10\\nyields the right-most digit of x (in base 10). Similarly x % 100 yields the last two digits.\\n5.2 Boolean expressions\\nA boolean expression is an expression that is either true or false. The following examples\\nuse the operator == , which compares two operands and produces True if they are equal\\nand False otherwise:\\n>>> 5 == 5\\nTrue\\n>>> 5 == 6\\nFalse\\nTrue and False are special values that belong to the type bool ; they are not strings:\\n>>> type(True)\\n<type ' bool ' >\\n>>> type(False)\\n<type ' bool ' >\"),\n",

Conditionals and recursion\\nThe == operator is one of the relational operators; the others are:\\nx != y # x is not equal to y\\nx > y # x is greater than y\\nx < y # x is less than y\\nx >= y # x is greater than or equal to y\\nx <= y # x is less than or equal to y\\nAlthough these operations are probably familiar to you, the Python symbols are different\\nfrom the mathematical symbols. A common error is to use a single equal sign (= ) instead of\\na double equal sign (== ). Remember that = is an assignment operator and == is a relational\\noperator. There is no such thing as =< or => .\\n5.3 Logical operators\\nThere are three logical operators : and , or , and not . The semantics (meaning) of these\\noperators is similar to their meaning in English. For example, x > 0 and x < 10 is true\\nonly if x is greater than 0 and less than 10.\\nn%2 == 0 or n%3 == 0 is true if either of the conditions is true, that is, if the number is\\ndivisible by 2 or 3.\\nFinally, the not operator negates a boolean expression, so not (x > y) is true if x > y is\\nfalse, that is, if x is less than or equal to y .\\nStrictly speaking, the operands of the logical operators should be boolean expressions, but\\nPython is not very strict. Any nonzero number is interpreted as “true.”\\n>>> 17 and True\\nTrue\\nThis ﬂexibility can be useful, but there are some subtleties to it that might be confusing.\\nYou might want to avoid it (unless you know what you are doing).\\n5.4 Conditional execution\\nIn order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to check conditions\\nand change the behavior of the program accordingly. Conditional statements give us this\\nability. The simplest form is the if statement:\\nif x > 0:\\nprint ' x is positive '\\nThe boolean expression after if is called the condition. If it is true, then the indented\\nstatement gets executed. If not, nothing happens.\\nif statements have the same structure as function deﬁnitions: a header followed by an\\nindented body. Statements like this are called compound statements.\\nThere is no limit on the number of statements that can appear in the body, but there has to\\nbe at least one. Occasionally, it is useful to have a body with no statements (usually as a\\nplace keeper for code you haven’t written yet). In that case, you can use thepass statement,\\nwhich does nothing.\\nif x < 0:\\npass # need to handle negative values!\"),\n",

Alternative execution 43\\n5.5 Alternative execution\\nA second form of the if statement is alternative execution, in which there are two possi-\\nbilities and the condition determines which one gets executed. The syntax looks like this:\\nif x%2 == 0:\\nprint ' x is even '\\nelse:\\nprint ' x is odd '\\nIf the remainder when x is divided by 2 is 0, then we know that x is even, and the program\\ndisplays a message to that effect. If the condition is false, the second set of statements is\\nexecuted. Since the condition must be true or false, exactly one of the alternatives will be\\nexecuted. The alternatives are called branches, because they are branches in the ﬂow of\\nexecution.\\n5.6 Chained conditionals\\nSometimes there are more than two possibilities and we need more than two branches.\\nOne way to express a computation like that is a chained conditional:\\nif x < y:\\nprint ' x is less than y '\\nelif x > y:\\nprint ' x is greater than y '\\nelse:\\nprint ' x and y are equal '\\nelif is an abbreviation of “else if.” Again, exactly one branch will be executed. There is no\\nlimit on the number of elif statements. If there is an else clause, it has to be at the end,\\nbut there doesn’t have to be one.\\nif choice == ' a ' :\\ndraw_a()\\nelif choice == ' b ' :\\ndraw_b()\\nelif choice == ' c ' :\\ndraw_c()\\nEach condition is checked in order. If the ﬁrst is false, the next is checked, and so on. If one\\nof them is true, the corresponding branch executes, and the statement ends. Even if more\\nthan one condition is true, only the ﬁrst true branch executes.\\n5.7 Nested conditionals\\nOne conditional can also be nested within another. We could have written the trichotomy\\nexample like this:\\nif x == y:\\nprint ' x and y are equal '\\nelse:\\nif x < y:\"),\n",

In general, it is a good idea to avoid them\\nwhen you can.\\nLogical operators often provide a way to simplify nested conditional statements. For ex-\\nample, we can rewrite the following code using a single conditional:\\nif 0 < x:\\nif x < 10:\\nprint ' x is a positive single-digit number.

It may\\nnot be obvious why that is a good thing, but it turns out to be one of the most magical\\nthings a program can do. For example, look at the following function:\\ndef countdown(n):\\nif n <= 0:\\nprint ' Blastoff! '\\nelse:\\nprint n\\ncountdown(n-1)\\nIf n is 0 or negative, it outputs the word, “Blastoff!” Otherwise, it outputs n and then calls\\na function named countdown —itself—passing n-1 as an argument.\\nWhat happens if we call this function like this?\\n>>> countdown(3)\\nThe execution of countdown begins with n=3 , and since n is greater than 0, it outputs the\\nvalue 3, and then calls itself...\\nThe execution of countdown begins with n=2 , and since n is greater than 0, it\\noutputs the value 2, and then calls itself...\\nThe execution of countdown begins with n=1 , and since n is greater\\nthan 0, it outputs the value 1, and then calls itself...\\nThe execution of countdown begins with n=0 , and since n is\\nnot greater than 0, it outputs the word, “Blastoff!” and then\\nreturns.\"),\n",

The ﬂow of execution immediately re-\\nturns to the caller, and the remaining lines of the function are not executed.\\nThe rest of the function is similar to countdown : if n is greater than 0, it displays s and then\\ncalls itself to display s n −1 additional times. So the number of lines of output is 1 + (n -\\n1) , which adds up to n .\\nFor simple examples like this, it is probably easier to use a for loop. But we will see\\nexamples later that are hard to write with afor loop and easy to write with recursion, so it\\nis good to start early.\\n5.9 Stack diagrams for recursive functions\\nIn Section 3.10, we used a stack diagram to represent the state of a program during a func-\\ntion call. The same kind of diagram can help interpret a recursive function.\\nEvery time a function gets called, Python creates a new function frame, which contains the\\nfunction’s local variables and parameters. For a recursive function, there might be more\\nthan one frame on the stack at the same time.\\nFigure 5.1 shows a stack diagram for countdown called with n = 3 .\\nAs usual, the top of the stack is the frame for __main__ . It is empty because we did not\\ncreate any variables in __main__ or pass any arguments to it.\\nThe four countdown frames have different values for the parameter n . The bottom of the\\nstack, where n=0 , is called the base case. It does not make a recursive call, so there are no\\nmore frames.\\nExercise 5.1. Draw a stack diagram for print_n called with s = ' Hello ' and n=2 .\\nExercise 5.2. Write a function called do_n that takes a function object and a number, n , as argu-\\nments, and that calls the given function n times.\"),\n",

When this function is called, the program stops and waits for\\nthe user to type something.

The goal of incremental development is to avoid long debugging\\nsessions by adding and testing only a small amount of code at a time.\\nAs an example, suppose you want to ﬁnd the distance between two points, given by the\\ncoordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). By the Pythagorean theorem, the distance is:\\ndistance =\\n√\\n(x2 −x1)2 + (y2 −y1)2\\nThe ﬁrst step is to consider what a distance function should look like in Python. In other\\nwords, what are the inputs (parameters) and what is the output (return value)?\\nIn this case, the inputs are two points, which you can represent using four numbers. The\\nreturn value is the distance, which is a ﬂoating-point value.\\nAlready you can write an outline of the function:\\ndef distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\\nreturn 0.0\\nObviously, this version doesn’t compute distances; it always returns zero. But it is syn-\\ntactically correct, and it runs, which means that you can test it before you make it more\\ncomplicated.\\nTo test the new function, call it with sample arguments:'),\n",

A reasonable next step is to ﬁnd the differences x2 −x1 and\\ny2 −y1. The next version stores those values in temporary variables and prints them.\\ndef distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\\ndx = x2 - x1\\ndy = y2 - y1\\nprint ' dx is ' , dx\\nprint ' dy is ' , dy\\nreturn 0.0\\nIf the function is working, it should display' dx is 3 ' and 'dy is 4' .

An alternative is what I call the “leap of faith.” When you come to a function\\ncall, instead of following the ﬂow of execution, youassume that the function works correctly\\nand returns the right result.\\nIn fact, you are already practicing this leap of faith when you use built-in functions. When\\nyou call math.cos or math.exp , you don’t examine the bodies of those functions. You just\\nassume that they work because the people who wrote the built-in functions were good\\nprogrammers.\\nThe same is true when you call one of your own functions. For example, in Section 6.4, we\\nwrote a function called is_divisible that determines whether one number is divisible by\\nanother. Once we have convinced ourselves that this function is correct—by examining the\\ncode and testing—we can use the function without looking at the body again.\\nThe same is true of recursive programs. When you get to the recursive call, instead of\\nfollowing the ﬂow of execution, you should assume that the recursive call works (yields\\nthe correct result) and then ask yourself, “Assuming that I can ﬁnd the factorial of n −1,\\ncan I compute the factorial of n?” In this case, it is clear that you can, by multiplying by n.\\nOf course, it’s a bit strange to assume that the function works correctly when you haven’t\\nﬁnished writing it, but that’s why it’s called a leap of faith!\\n6.7 One more example\\nAfter factorial , the most common example of a recursively deﬁned mathematical func-\\ntion is fibonacci , which has the following deﬁnition (see http://en.wikipedia.org/\\nwiki/Fibonacci_number ):\\nﬁbonacci(0) =0\\nﬁbonacci(1) =1\\nﬁbonacci(n) =ﬁbonacci(n −1) +ﬁbonacci(n −2)\\nTranslated into Python, it looks like this:'),\n",

In the next, it is -0.5. From there, it gets\\nsmaller (more negative), but it will never be 0.\\nWe have two choices. We can try to generalize the factorial function to work with\\nﬂoating-point numbers, or we can make factorial check the type of its argument. The\\nﬁrst option is called the gamma function and it’s a little beyond the scope of this book.

The guardians make it possible to prove the correctness of the code.\\nIn Section 11.3 we will see a more ﬂexible alternative to printing an error message: raising\\nan exception.\\n6.9 Debugging\\nBreaking a large program into smaller functions creates natural checkpoints for debugging.\\nIf a function is not working, there are three possibilities to consider:\\n• There is something wrong with the arguments the function is getting; a precondition\\nis violated.\\n• There is something wrong with the function; a postcondition is violated.\\n• There is something wrong with the return value or the way it is being used.\\nTo rule out the ﬁrst possibility, you can add a print statement at the beginning of the\\nfunction and display the values of the parameters (and maybe their types). Or you can\\nwrite code that checks the preconditions explicitly.\\nIf the parameters look good, add a print statement before each return statement that dis-\\nplays the return value. If possible, check the result by hand. Consider calling the function\\nwith values that make it easy to check the result (as in Section 6.2).\\nIf the function seems to be working, look at the function call to make sure the return value\\nis being used correctly (or used at all!).\\nAdding print statements at the beginning and end of a function can help make the ﬂow of\\nexecution more visible. For example, here is a version of factorial with print statements:\\ndef factorial(n):\\nspace = ' ' * (4 * n)\\nprint space, ' factorial ' , n\\nif n == 0:\\nprint space, ' returning 1 '\\nreturn 1\\nelse:\\nrecurse = factorial(n-1)\\nresult = n * recurse\\nprint space, ' returning ' , result\\nreturn result\\nspace is a string of space characters that controls the indentation of the output. Here is the\\nresult of factorial(5) :\"),\n",

A new assignment makes an existing variable refer to a new value (and stop\\nreferring to the old value).\\nbruce = 5\\nprint bruce,\\nbruce = 7\\nprint bruce\\nThe output of this program is 5 7 , because the ﬁrst time bruce is printed, its value is 5,\\nand the second time, its value is 7. The comma at the end of the ﬁrst print statement\\nsuppresses the newline, which is why both outputs appear on the same line.\\nFigure 7.1 shows what multiple assignment looks like in a state diagram.\\nWith multiple assignment it is especially important to distinguish between an assignment\\noperation and a statement of equality. Because Python uses the equal sign ( = ) for assign-\\nment, it is tempting to interpret a statement like a = b as a statement of equality. It is not!\\nFirst, equality is a symmetric relation and assignment is not. For example, in mathematics,\\nif a = 7 then 7 = a. But in Python, the statement a = 7 is legal and 7 = a is not.\\nFurthermore, in mathematics, a statement of equality is either true or false, for all time. If\\na = b now, then a will always equal b. In Python, an assignment statement can make two\\nvariables equal, but they don’t have to stay that way:\\na = 5\\nb = a # a and b are now equal\\na = 3 # a and b are no longer equal\\nThe third line changes the value of a but does not change the value of b , so they are no\\nlonger equal.\\nAlthough multiple assignment is frequently helpful, you should use it with caution. If the\\nvalues of variables change frequently, it can make the code difﬁcult to read and debug.'),\n",

Repeating identical or similar tasks\\nwithout making errors is something that computers do well and people do poorly.\\nWe have seen two programs, countdown and print_n , that use recursion to perform rep-\\netition, which is also called iteration. Because iteration is so common, Python provides\\nseveral language features to make it easier. One is thefor statement we saw in Section 4.2.\\nWe’ll get back to that later.\\nAnother is thewhile statement. Here is a version ofcountdown that uses awhile statement:\\ndef countdown(n):\\nwhile n > 0:\\nprint n\\nn = n-1\\nprint ' Blastoff! '\\nYou can almost read thewhile statement as if it were English. It means, “Whilen is greater\\nthan 0, display the value of n and then reduce the value of n by 1. When you get to 0,\\ndisplay the word Blastoff! ”\\nMore formally, here is the ﬂow of execution for a while statement:\\n1. Evaluate the condition, yielding True or False .\"),\n",

If the condition is true, execute the body and then go back to step 1.\\nThis type of ﬂow is called a loop because the third step loops back around to the top.\\nThe body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that eventu-\\nally the condition becomes false and the loop terminates. Otherwise the loop will repeat\\nforever, which is called an inﬁnite loop . An endless source of amusement for computer\\nscientists is the observation that the directions on shampoo, “Lather, rinse, repeat,” are an\\ninﬁnite loop.\\nIn the case of countdown , we can prove that the loop terminates because we know that the\\nvalue of n is ﬁnite, and we can see that the value of n gets smaller each time through the\\nloop, so eventually we have to get to 0. In other cases, it is not so easy to tell:\\ndef sequence(n):\\nwhile n != 1:\\nprint n,\\nif n%2 == 0: # n is even\\nn = n/2\\nelse: # n is odd\\nn = n*3+1\\nThe condition for this loop is n != 1 , so the loop will continue until n is 1 , which makes\\nthe condition false.\\nEach time through the loop, the program outputs the value of n and then checks whether\\nit is even or odd. If it is even, n is divided by 2. If it is odd, the value of n is replaced with\\nn*3+1 . For example, if the argument passed to sequence is 3, the resulting sequence is 3,\\n10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.\\nSince n sometimes increases and sometimes decreases, there is no obvious proof thatn will\\never reach 1, or that the program terminates. For some particular values ofn , we can prove\\ntermination. For example, if the starting value is a power of two, then the value ofn will be\\neven each time through the loop until it reaches 1. The previous example ends with such a\\nsequence, starting with 16.\\nThe hard question is whether we can prove that this program terminates for all posi-\\ntive values of n .

Iteration\\nBut if you were “lazy,” you probably cheated by learning a few tricks. For example, to\\nﬁnd the product of n and 9, you can write n −1 as the ﬁrst digit and 10 −n as the second\\ndigit. This trick is a general solution for multiplying any single-digit number by 9. That’s\\nan algorithm!\\nSimilarly, the techniques you learned for addition with carrying, subtraction with borrow-\\ning, and long division are all algorithms. One of the characteristics of algorithms is that\\nthey do not require any intelligence to carry out. They are mechanical processes in which\\neach step follows from the last according to a simple set of rules.\\nIn my opinion, it is embarrassing that humans spend so much time in school learning to\\nexecute algorithms that, quite literally, require no intelligence.\\nOn the other hand, the process of designing algorithms is interesting, intellectually chal-\\nlenging, and a central part of what we call programming.\\nSome of the things that people do naturally, without difﬁculty or conscious thought, are\\nthe hardest to express algorithmically. Understanding natural language is a good example.\\nWe all do it, but so far no one has been able to explainhow we do it, at least not in the form\\nof an algorithm.\\n7.7 Debugging\\nAs you start writing bigger programs, you might ﬁnd yourself spending more time debug-\\nging. More code means more chances to make an error and more place for bugs to hide.\\nOne way to cut your debugging time is “debugging by bisection.” For example, if there\\nare 100 lines in your program and you check them one at a time, it would take 100 steps.\\nInstead, try to break the problem in half. Look at the middle of the program, or near it, for\\nan intermediate value you can check. Add a print statement (or something else that has a\\nveriﬁable effect) and run the program.\\nIf the mid-point check is incorrect, there must be a problem in the ﬁrst half of the program.\\nIf it is correct, the problem is in the second half.\\nEvery time you perform a check like this, you halve the number of lines you have to search.\\nAfter six steps (which is fewer than 100), you would be down to one or two lines of code,\\nat least in theory.\\nIn practice it is not always clear what the “middle of the program” is and not always pos-\\nsible to check it. It doesn’t make sense to count lines and ﬁnd the exact midpoint. Instead,\\nthink about places in the program where there might be errors and places where it is easy\\nto put a check. Then choose a spot where you think the chances are about the same that\\nthe bug is before or after the check.\\n7.8 Glossary\\nmultiple assignment: Making more than one assignment to the same variable during the\\nexecution of a program.'),\n",

Often they start\\nat the beginning, select each character in turn, do something to it, and continue until the\\nend. This pattern of processing is called a traversal. One way to write a traversal is with a\\nwhile loop:\\nindex = 0\\nwhile index < len(fruit):\\nletter = fruit[index]\\nprint letter\\nindex = index + 1\\nThis loop traverses the string and displays each letter on a line by itself. The loop condition\\nis index < len(fruit) , so when index is equal to the length of the string, the condition is\\nfalse, and the body of the loop is not executed. The last character accessed is the one with\\nthe index len(fruit)-1 , which is the last character in the string.\\nExercise 8.1. Write a function that takes a string as an argument and displays the letters backward,\\none per line.\\nAnother way to write a traversal is with a for loop:\\nfor char in fruit:\\nprint char\\nEach time through the loop, the next character in the string is assigned to the variablechar .\\nThe loop continues until no characters are left.\\nThe following example shows how to use concatenation (string addition) and a for loop\\nto generate an abecedarian series (that is, in alphabetical order).

Given that fruit is a string, what does fruit[:] mean?\\n8.5 Strings are immutable\\nIt is tempting to use the [] operator on the left side of an assignment, with the intention of\\nchanging a character in a string. For example:\\n>>> greeting = ' Hello, world! '\\n>>> greeting[0] = ' J '\\nTypeError: ' str ' object does not support item assignment\\nThe “object” in this case is the string and the “item” is the character you tried to assign. For\\nnow, an object is the same thing as a value, but we will reﬁne that deﬁnition later. Anitem\\nis one of the values in a sequence.\\nThe reason for the error is that strings are immutable, which means you can’t change an\\nexisting string. The best you can do is create a new string that is a variation on the original:\\n>>> greeting = ' Hello, world! '\\n>>> new_greeting = ' J ' + greeting[1:]\\n>>> print new_greeting\\nJello, world!\\nThis example concatenates a new ﬁrst letter onto a slice of greeting .

Instead of taking an index and extracting\\nthe corresponding character, it takes a character and ﬁnds the index where that character\\nappears. If the character is not found, the function returns -1 .\\nThis is the ﬁrst example we have seen of a return statement inside a loop. If word[index]\\n== letter , the function breaks out of the loop and returns immediately.\\nIf the character doesn’t appear in the string, the program exits the loop normally and re-\\nturns -1 .\\nThis pattern of computation—traversing a sequence and returning when we ﬁnd what we\\nare looking for—is called a search.\\nExercise 8.4.

So, if my car had 300,000\\nmiles, for example, I’d see 3-0-0-0-0-0.\\n“Now, what I saw that day was very interesting. I noticed that the last 4 digits were\\npalindromic; that is, they read the same forward as backward. For example, 5-4-4-5 is a\\npalindrome, so my odometer could have read 3-1-5-4-4-5.\\n“One mile later, the last 5 numbers were palindromic. For example, it could have read\\n3-6-5-4-5-6. One mile after that, the middle 4 out of 6 numbers were palindromic. And\\nyou ready for this?

The assignment statement\\nin the body uses i to read the old value of the element and to assign the new value.\\nA for loop over an empty list never executes the body:\\nfor x in []:\\nprint ' This never happens.

For example, the following\\nfunction takes a list of strings and returns a new list that contains capitalized strings:\\ndef capitalize_all(t):\\nres = []\\nfor s in t:\\nres.append(s.capitalize())\\nreturn res\\nres is initialized with an empty list; each time through the loop, we append the next ele-\\nment. So res is another kind of accumulator.\\nAn operation like capitalize_all is sometimes called a map because it “maps” a function\\n(in this case the method capitalize ) onto each of the elements in a sequence.\\nExercise 10.2. Use capitalize_all to write a function named capitalize_nested that takes\\na nested list of strings and returns a new nested list with all strings capitalized.\\nAnother common operation is to select some of the elements from a list and return a sublist.\\nFor example, the following function takes a list of strings and returns a list that contains\\nonly the uppercase strings:\\ndef only_upper(t):\\nres = []\\nfor s in t:'),\n",

Write a function called middle that takes a list and returns a new list that contains\\nall but the ﬁrst and last elements. So middle([1,2,3,4]) should return [2,3] .\\nExercise 10.5.

Lists and strings 93\\n10.9 Lists and strings\\nA string is a sequence of characters and a list is a sequence of values, but a list of characters\\nis not the same as a string. To convert from a string to a list of characters, you can uselist :\\n>>> s = ' spam '\\n>>> t = list(s)\\n>>> print t\\n[ ' s ' , ' p ' , ' a ' , ' m ' ]\\nBecause list is the name of a built-in function, you should avoid using it as a variable\\nname. I also avoid l because it looks too much like 1 . So that’s why I uset .\\nThe list function breaks a string into individual letters. If you want to break a string into\\nwords, you can use the split method:\\n>>> s = ' pining for the fjords '\\n>>> t = s.split()\\n>>> print t\\n[ ' pining ' , ' for ' , ' the ' , ' fjords ' ]\\nAn optional argument called a delimiter speciﬁes which characters to use as word bound-\\naries. The following example uses a hyphen as a delimiter:\\n>>> s = ' spam-spam-spam '\\n>>> delimiter = ' - '\\n>>> s.split(delimiter)\\n[ ' spam ' , ' spam ' , ' spam ' ]\\njoin is the inverse of split . It takes a list of strings and concatenates the elements. join is\\na string method, so you have to invoke it on the delimiter and pass the list as a parameter:\\n>>> t = [ ' pining ' , ' for ' , ' the ' , ' fjords ' ]\\n>>> delimiter = ' '\\n>>> delimiter.join(t)\\n' pining for the fjords '\\nIn this case the delimiter is a space character, so join puts a space between words. To\\nconcatenate strings without spaces, you can use the empty string, '' , as a delimiter.\\n10.10 Objects and values\\nIf we execute these assignment statements:\\na = ' banana '\\nb = ' banana '\\nWe know that a and b both refer to a string, but we don’t know whether they refer to the\\nsame string. There are two possible states, shown in Figure 10.2.\\nIn one case, a and b refer to two different objects that have the same value. In the second\\ncase, they refer to the same object.\\nTo check whether two variables refer to the same object, you can use the is operator.\"),\n",

The stack diagram\\nlooks like Figure 10.5.\\nSince the list is shared by two frames, I drew it between them.\\nIt is important to distinguish between operations that modify lists and operations that cre-\\nate new lists.

Make copies to avoid aliasing.\\nIf you want to use a method like sort that modiﬁes the argument, but you need to\\nkeep the original list as well, you can make a copy.\\norig = t[:]\\nt.sort()\\nIn this example you could also use the built-in functionsorted , which returns a new,\\nsorted list and leaves the original alone.

In a list, the indices have to be integers; in a\\ndictionary they can be (almost) any type.\\nYou can think of a dictionary as a mapping between a set of indices (which are calledkeys)\\nand a set of values. Each key maps to a value. The association of a key and a value is called\\na key-value pair or sometimes an item.\\nAs an example, we’ll build a dictionary that maps from English to Spanish words, so the\\nkeys and the values are all strings.\\nThe function dict creates a new dictionary with no items.

To add items to the dictionary,\\nyou can use square brackets:\\n>>> eng2sp[ ' one ' ] = ' uno '\\nThis line creates an item that maps from the key 'one' to the value ' uno ' . If we print the\\ndictionary again, we see a key-value pair with a colon between the key and value:\\n>>> print eng2sp\\n{ ' one ' : ' uno ' }\\nThis output format is also an input format. For example, you can create a new dictionary\\nwith three items:\\n>>> eng2sp = { ' one ' : ' uno ' , ' two ' : ' dos ' , ' three ' : ' tres ' }\\nBut if you print eng2sp , you might be surprised:\\n>>> print eng2sp\\n{ ' one ' : ' uno ' , ' three ' : ' tres ' , ' two ' : ' dos ' }\\nThe order of the key-value pairs is not the same. In fact, if you type the same example\\non your computer, you might get a different result.

Write a function that reads the words in words.txt and stores them as keys in a\\ndictionary. It doesn’t matter what the values are. Then you can use thein operator as a fast way to\\ncheck whether a string is in the dictionary.\\nIf you did Exercise 10.11, you can compare the speed of this implementation with the listin operator\\nand the bisection search.\\n11.1 Dictionary as a set of counters\\nSuppose you are given a string and you want to count how many times each letter appears.\\nThere are several ways you could do it:\\n1. You could create 26 variables, one for each letter of the alphabet. Then you could tra-\\nverse the string and, for each character, increment the corresponding counter, proba-\\nbly using a chained conditional.\\n2. You could create a list with 26 elements. Then you could convert each character to\\na number (using the built-in function ord ), use the number as an index into the list,\\nand increment the appropriate counter.\"),\n",

Looping and dictionaries 103\\n3. You could create a dictionary with characters as keys and counters as the correspond-\\ning values. The ﬁrst time you see a character, you would add an item to the dictionary.\\nAfter that you would increment the value of an existing item.\\nEach of these options performs the same computation, but each of them implements that\\ncomputation in a different way.\\nAn implementation is a way of performing a computation; some implementations are\\nbetter than others. For example, an advantage of the dictionary implementation is that we\\ndon’t have to know ahead of time which letters appear in the string and we only have to\\nmake room for the letters that do appear.\\nHere is what the code might look like:\\ndef histogram(s):\\nd = dict()\\nfor c in s:\\nif c not in d:\\nd[c] = 1\\nelse:\\nd[c] += 1\\nreturn d\\nThe name of the function is histogram, which is a statistical term for a set of counters (or\\nfrequencies).\\nThe ﬁrst line of the function creates an empty dictionary. Thefor loop traverses the string.\\nEach time through the loop, if the character c is not in the dictionary, we create a new item\\nwith key c and the initial value 1 (since we have seen this letter once). If c is already in the\\ndictionary we increment d[c] .\\nHere’s how it works:\\n>>> h = histogram( ' brontosaurus ' )\\n>>> print h\\n{ ' a ' : 1, ' b ' : 1, ' o ' : 2, ' n ' : 1, ' s ' : 2, ' r ' : 2, ' u ' : 2, ' t ' : 1}\\nThe histogram indicates that the letters 'a' and ' b ' appear once; ' o ' appears twice, and\\nso on.\\nExercise 11.2. Dictionaries have a method called get that takes a key and a default value. If the\\nkey appears in the dictionary, get returns the corresponding value; otherwise it returns the default\\nvalue. For example:\\n>>> h = histogram( ' a ' )\\n>>> print h\\n{ ' a ' : 1}\\n>>> h.get( ' a ' , 0)\\n1\\n>>> h.get( ' b ' , 0)\\n0\\nUse get to write histogram more concisely. You should be able to eliminate the if statement.\\n11.2 Looping and dictionaries\\nIf you use a dictionary in a for statement, it traverses the keys of the dictionary.

This\\noperation is called a lookup.\\nBut what if you have v and you want to ﬁnd k ? You have two problems: ﬁrst, there might\\nbe more than one key that maps to the value v . Depending on the application, you might\\nbe able to pick one, or you might have to make a list that contains all of them. Second,\\nthere is no simple syntax to do a reverse lookup; you have to search.\\nHere is a function that takes a value and returns the ﬁrst key that maps to that value:\\ndef reverse_lookup(d, v):\\nfor k in d:\\nif d[k] == v:\\nreturn k\\nraise ValueError\\nThis function is yet another example of the search pattern, but it uses a feature we haven’t\\nseen before, raise . The raise statement causes an exception; in this case it causes a\\nValueError , which generally indicates that there is something wrong with the value of\\na parameter.\\nIf we get to the end of the loop, that meansv doesn’t appear in the dictionary as a value, so\\nwe raise an exception.\\nHere is an example of a successful reverse lookup:\\n>>> h = histogram( ' parrot ' )\\n>>> k = reverse_lookup(h, 2)\\n>>> print k\\nr\\nAnd an unsuccessful one:\"),\n",

Modify reverse_lookup so that it builds and returns a list of all keys that map to\\nv , or an empty list if there are none.\\n11.4 Dictionaries and lists\\nLists can appear as values in a dictionary. For example, if you were given a dictionary that\\nmaps from letters to frequencies, you might want to invert it; that is, create a dictionary\\nthat maps from frequencies to letters. Since there might be several letters with the same\\nfrequency, each value in the inverted dictionary should be a list of letters.\\nHere is a function that inverts a dictionary:\\ndef invert_dict(d):\\ninverse = dict()\\nfor key in d:\\nval = d[key]\\nif val not in inverse:\\ninverse[val] = [key]\\nelse:\\ninverse[val].append(key)\\nreturn inverse\\nEach time through the loop, key gets a key from d and val gets the corresponding value.\\nIf val is not in inverse , that means we haven’t seen it before, so we create a new item and\\ninitialize it with a singleton (a list that contains a single element). Otherwise we have seen\\nthis value before, so we append the corresponding key to the list.\\nHere is an example:\\n>>> hist = histogram( \\' parrot \\' )\\n>>> print hist\\n{ \\' a \\' : 1, \\' p \\' : 1, \\' r \\' : 2, \\' t \\' : 1, \\' o \\' : 1}\\n>>> inverse = invert_dict(hist)\\n>>> print inverse\\n{1: [ \\' a \\' , \\' p \\' , \\' t \\' , \\' o \\' ], 2: [ \\' r \\' ]}'),\n",

But if the keys are mutable, like lists,\\nbad things happen. For example, when you create a key-value pair, Python hashes the key\\nand stores it in the corresponding location. If you modify the key and then hash it again, it\\nwould go to a different location. In that case you might have two entries for the same key,\\nor you might not be able to ﬁnd a key. Either way, the dictionary wouldn’t work correctly.\\nThat’s why the keys have to be hashable, and why mutable types like lists aren’t. The\\nsimplest way to get around this limitation is to use tuples, which we will see in the next\\nchapter.\\nSince lists and dictionaries are mutable, they can’t be used as keys, but theycan be used as\\nvalues.\\nExercise 11.5.

Variables in __main__ are sometimes called global because they\\ncan be accessed from any function. Unlike local variables, which disappear when their\\nfunction ends, global variables persist from one function call to the next.\\nIt is common to use global variables forﬂags; that is, boolean variables that indicate (“ﬂag”)\\nwhether a condition is true. For example, some programs use a ﬂag named verbose to\\ncontrol the level of detail in the output:\\nverbose = True\\ndef example1():\\nif verbose:\\nprint ' Running example1 '\\nIf you try to reassign a global variable, you might be surprised. The following example is\\nsupposed to keep track of whether the function has been called:\\nbeen_called = False\\ndef example2():\\nbeen_called = True # WRONG\\nBut if you run it you will see that the value of been_called doesn’t change. The problem\\nis that example2 creates a new local variable named been_called . The local variable goes\\naway when the function ends, and has no effect on the global variable.\\nTo reassign a global variable inside a function you have todeclare the global variable before\\nyou use it:\\nbeen_called = False\\ndef example2():\\nglobal been_called\\nbeen_called = True\\nThe global statement tells the interpreter something like, “In this function, when I say\\nbeen_called , I mean the global variable; don’t create a local one.”\\nHere’s an example that tries to update a global variable:\\ncount = 0\\ndef example3():\\ncount = count + 1 # WRONG\\nIf you run it you get:\\nUnboundLocalError: local variable ' count ' referenced before assignment\\nPython assumes that count is local, which means that you are reading it before writing it.\\nThe solution, again, is to declare count global.\\ndef example3():\\nglobal count\\ncount += 1\\nIf the global value is mutable, you can modify it without declaring it:\"),\n",

Replace the ﬁrst letter, that is, put it back and remove\\nthe second letter and the result is yet another homophone of the original word.

It must have been a nine-pointer!’ It’s a perfect homophone. If you\\nput the ‘w’ back, and remove the ‘r,’ instead, you’re left with the word, ‘wack,’ which is\\na real word, it’s just not a homophone of the other two words.\\nBut there is, however, at least one word that Dan and we know of, which will yield two\\nhomophones if you remove either of the ﬁrst two letters to make two, new four-letter\\nwords. The question is, what’s the word?\\nYou can use the dictionary from Exercise 11.1 to check whether a string is in the word list.\\nTo check whether two words are homophones, you can use the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary.\\nYou can download it from http: // www. speech. cs. cmu. edu/ cgi- bin/ cmudict or from\\nhttp: // thinkpython. com/ code/ c06d and you can also download http: // thinkpython.\\ncom/ code/ pronounce. py , which provides a function named read_dictionary that reads the\\npronouncing dictionary and returns a Python dictionary that maps from each word to a string that\\ndescribes its primary pronunciation.\\nWrite a program that lists all the words that solve the Puzzler.

With conventional assignments, you\\nhave to use a temporary variable. For example, to swap a and b :\\n>>> temp = a\\n>>> a = b\\n>>> b = temp\\nThis solution is cumbersome; tuple assignment is more elegant:\\n>>> a, b = b, a\\nThe left side is a tuple of variables; the right side is a tuple of expressions. Each value\\nis assigned to its respective variable. All the expressions on the right side are evaluated\\nbefore any of the assignments.\\nThe number of variables on the left and the number of values on the right have to be the\\nsame:\\n>>> a, b = 1, 2, 3\\nValueError: too many values to unpack\\nMore generally, the right side can be any kind of sequence (string, list or tuple). For exam-\\nple, to split an email address into a user name and a domain, you could write:\\n>>> addr = ' monty@python.org '\\n>>> uname, domain = addr.split( ' @ ' )\\nThe return value from split is a list with two elements; the ﬁrst element is assigned to\\nuname , the second to domain .\\n>>> print uname\\nmonty\\n>>> print domain\\npython.org\"),\n",

For example, if you want to divide two integers\\nand compute the quotient and remainder, it is inefﬁcient to compute x/y and then x%y .

You can store the result as a tuple:\\n>>> t = divmod(7, 3)\\n>>> print t\\n(2, 1)\\nOr use tuple assignment to store the elements separately:\\n>>> quot, rem = divmod(7, 3)\\n>>> print quot\\n2\\n>>> print rem\\n1\\nHere is an example of a function that returns a tuple:\\ndef min_max(t):\\nreturn min(t), max(t)\\nmax and min are built-in functions that ﬁnd the largest and smallest elements of a sequence.\\nmin_max computes both and returns a tuple of two values.\\n12.4 Variable-length argument tuples\\nFunctions can take a variable number of arguments.

The output of this loop is:\\n0 a\\n1 b\\n2 c\\nIf you combine zip , for and tuple assignment, you get a useful idiom for traversing two\\n(or more) sequences at the same time. For example, has_match takes two sequences, t1\\nand t2 , and returns True if there is an index i such that t1[i] == t2[i] :\\ndef has_match(t1, t2):\\nfor x, y in zip(t1, t2):\\nif x == y:\\nreturn True\\nreturn False\\nIf you need to traverse the elements of a sequence and their indices, you can use the built-in\\nfunction enumerate :\\nfor index, element in enumerate( ' abc ' ):\\nprint index, element\"),\n",

If you need the ability to change the\\ncharacters in a string (as opposed to creating a new string), you might want to use a list of\\ncharacters instead.\\nLists are more common than tuples, mostly because they are mutable.

For example, in a real sentence you would expect an article like “the” to\\nbe followed by an adjective or a noun, and probably not a verb or adverb.\\nOne way to measure these kinds of relationships is Markov analysis, which characterizes,\\nfor a given sequence of words, the probability of the word that comes next. For example,\\nthe song Eric, the Half a Bee begins:\\nHalf a bee, philosophically,\\nMust, ipso facto, half not be.\\nBut half the bee has got to be\\nVis a vis, its entity.

Data structures 129\\nIn this text, the phrase “half the” is always followed by the word “bee,” but the phrase “the\\nbee” might be followed by either “has” or “is”.\\nThe result of Markov analysis is a mapping from each preﬁx (like “half the” and “the bee”)\\nto all possible sufﬁxes (like “has” and “is”).\\nGiven this mapping, you can generate a random text by starting with any preﬁx and choos-\\ning at random from the possible sufﬁxes. Next, you can combine the end of the preﬁx and\\nthe new sufﬁx to form the next preﬁx, and repeat.\\nFor example, if you start with the preﬁx “Half a,” then the next word has to be “bee,”\\nbecause the preﬁx only appears once in the text. The next preﬁx is “a bee,” so the next\\nsufﬁx might be “philosophically,” “be” or “due.”\\nIn this example the length of the preﬁx is always two, but you can do Markov analysis with\\nany preﬁx length. The length of the preﬁx is called the “order” of the analysis.\\nExercise 13.8. Markov analysis:\\n1. Write a program to read a text from a ﬁle and perform Markov analysis. The result should be\\na dictionary that maps from preﬁxes to a collection of possible sufﬁxes. The collection might\\nbe a list, tuple, or dictionary; it is up to you to make an appropriate choice. You can test your\\nprogram with preﬁx length two, but you should write the program in a way that makes it easy\\nto try other lengths.\\n2. Add a function to the previous program to generate random text based on the Markov analysis.\\nHere is an example from Emma with preﬁx length 2:\\nHe was very clever, be it sweetness or be angry, ashamed or only amused, at such\\na stroke. She had never thought of Hannah till you were never meant for me?\" \"I\\ncannot make speeches, Emma:\" he soon cut it all himself.\\nFor this example, I left the punctuation attached to the words. The result is almost syntacti-\\ncally correct, but not quite. Semantically, it almost makes sense, but not quite.\\nWhat happens if you increase the preﬁx length? Does the random text make more sense?\\n3. Once your program is working, you might want to try a mash-up: if you analyze text from\\ntwo or more books, the random text you generate will blend the vocabulary and phrases from\\nthe sources in interesting ways.\\nCredit: This case study is based on an example from Kernighan and Pike, The Practice of Pro-\\ngramming, Addison-Wesley, 1999.\\nYou should attempt this exercise before you go on; then you can can download my\\nsolution from http://thinkpython.com/code/markov.py .

Case study: data structure selection\\n• How to represent the collection of possible sufﬁxes.\\n• How to represent the mapping from each preﬁx to the collection of possible sufﬁxes.\\nOk, the last one is easy; the only mapping type we have seen is a dictionary, so it is the\\nnatural choice.\\nFor the preﬁxes, the most obvious options are string, list of strings, or tuple of strings. For\\nthe sufﬁxes, one option is a list; another is a histogram (dictionary).\\nHow should you choose? The ﬁrst step is to think about the operations you will need to\\nimplement for each data structure. For the preﬁxes, we need to be able to remove words\\nfrom the beginning and add to the end. For example, if the current preﬁx is “Half a,” and\\nthe next word is “bee,” you need to be able to form the next preﬁx, “a bee.”\\nYour ﬁrst choice might be a list, since it is easy to add and remove elements, but we also\\nneed to be able to use the preﬁxes as keys in a dictionary, so that rules out lists. With tuples,\\nyou can’t append or remove, but you can use the addition operator to form a new tuple:\\ndef shift(prefix, word):\\nreturn prefix[1:] + (word,)\\nshift takes a tuple of words, prefix , and a string, word , and forms a new tuple that has\\nall the words in prefix except the ﬁrst, and word added to the end.\\nFor the collection of sufﬁxes, the operations we need to perform include adding a new\\nsufﬁx (or increasing the frequency of an existing one), and choosing a random sufﬁx.\\nAdding a new sufﬁx is equally easy for the list implementation or the histogram. Choosing\\na random element from a list is easy; choosing from a histogram is harder to do efﬁciently\\n(see Exercise 13.7).\\nSo far we have been talking mostly about ease of implementation, but there are other fac-\\ntors to consider in choosing data structures. One is run time. Sometimes there is a theoreti-\\ncal reason to expect one data structure to be faster than other; for example, I mentioned that\\nthe in operator is faster for dictionaries than for lists, at least when the number of elements\\nis large.\\nBut often you don’t know ahead of time which implementation will be faster. One option is\\nto implement both of them and see which is better. This approach is calledbenchmarking.\\nA practical alternative is to choose the data structure that is easiest to implement, and then\\nsee if it is fast enough for the intended application. If so, there is no need to go on. If not,\\nthere are tools, like the profile module, that can identify the places in a program that take\\nthe most time.\\nThe other factor to consider is storage space. For example, using a histogram for the col-\\nlection of sufﬁxes might take less space because you only have to store each word once, no\\nmatter how many times it appears in the text. In some cases, saving space can also make\\nyour program run faster, and in the extreme, your program might not run at all if you run\\nout of memory. But for many applications, space is a secondary consideration after run\\ntime.\\nOne ﬁnal thought: in this discussion, I have implied that we should use one data structure\\nfor both analysis and generation. But since these are separate phases, it would also be pos-\\nsible to use one structure for analysis and then convert to another structure for generation.\\nThis would be a net win if the time saved during generation exceeded the time spent in\\nconversion.'),\n",

Debugging 131\\n13.10 Debugging\\nWhen you are debugging a program, and especially if you are working on a hard bug,\\nthere are four things to try:\\nreading: Examine your code, read it back to yourself, and check that it says what you\\nmeant to say.\\nrunning: Experiment by making changes and running different versions. Often if you dis-\\nplay the right thing at the right place in the program, the problem becomes obvious,\\nbut sometimes you have to spend some time to build scaffolding.\\nruminating: Take some time to think! What kind of error is it: syntax, runtime, semantic?\\nWhat information can you get from the error messages, or from the output of the\\nprogram? What kind of error could cause the problem you’re seeing? What did you\\nchange last, before the problem appeared?\\nretreating: At some point, the best thing to do is back off, undoing recent changes, until\\nyou get back to a program that works and that you understand. Then you can start\\nrebuilding.\\nBeginning programmers sometimes get stuck on one of these activities and forget the oth-\\ners. Each activity comes with its own failure mode.\\nFor example, reading your code might help if the problem is a typographical error, but\\nnot if the problem is a conceptual misunderstanding. If you don’t understand what your\\nprogram does, you can read it 100 times and never see the error, because the error is in\\nyour head.\\nRunning experiments can help, especially if you run small, simple tests. But if you run\\nexperiments without thinking or reading your code, you might fall into a pattern I call\\n“random walk programming,” which is the process of making random changes until the\\nprogram does the right thing. Needless to say, random walk programming can take a long\\ntime.\\nYou have to take time to think. Debugging is like an experimental science. You should have\\nat least one hypothesis about what the problem is. If there are two or more possibilities, try\\nto think of a test that would eliminate one of them.\\nTaking a break helps with the thinking. So does talking. If you explain the problem to\\nsomeone else (or even yourself), you will sometimes ﬁnd the answer before you ﬁnish\\nasking the question.\\nBut even the best debugging techniques will fail if there are too many errors, or if the code\\nyou are trying to ﬁx is too big and complicated. Sometimes the best option is to retreat,\\nsimplifying the program until you get to something that works and that you understand.\\nBeginning programmers are often reluctant to retreat because they can’t stand to delete a\\nline of code (even if it’s wrong). If it makes you feel better, copy your program into another\\nﬁle before you start stripping it down. Then you can paste the pieces back in a little bit at a\\ntime.\\nFinding a hard bug requires reading, running, ruminating, and sometimes retreating. If\\nyou get stuck on one of these activities, try the others.'),\n",

If you take the logarithm of\\nboth sides of this equation, you get:\\nlog f = log c −s log r\\nSo if you plot log f versus log r, you should get a straight line with slope −s and intercept log c.\\nWrite a program that reads a text from a ﬁle, counts word frequencies, and prints one line for each\\nword, in descending order of frequency, with log f and log r. Use the graphing program of your\\nchoice to plot the results and check whether they form a straight line. Can you estimate the value of\\ns?\\nSolution: http: // thinkpython. com/ code/ zipf. py . To make the plots, you might have to\\ninstall matplotlib (see http: // matplotlib. sourceforge. net/ ).\"),\n",

If you run the\\nprogram again, it starts with a clean slate.\\nOther programs are persistent: they run for a long time (or all the time); they keep at least\\nsome of their data in permanent storage (a hard drive, for example); and if they shut down\\nand restart, they pick up where they left off.\\nExamples of persistent programs are operating systems, which run pretty much whenever\\na computer is on, and web servers, which run all the time, waiting for requests to come in\\non the network.\\nOne of the simplest ways for programs to maintain their data is by reading and writing\\ntext ﬁles. We have already seen programs that read text ﬁles; in this chapter we will see\\nprograms that write them.\\nAn alternative is to store the state of the program in a database.

But when the ﬁrst operand is a string, % is the format operator.\\nThe ﬁrst operand is the format string , which contains one or more format sequences ,\\nwhich specify how the second operand is formatted. The result is a string.\\nFor example, the format sequence \\' %d \\' means that the second operand should be format-\\nted as an integer (d stands for “decimal”):\\n>>> camels = 42\\n>>> \\' %d \\' % camels\\n\\' 42 \\'\\nThe result is the string \\' 42 \\' , which is not to be confused with the integer value 42 .\\nA format sequence can appear anywhere in the string, so you can embed a value in a\\nsentence:\\n>>> camels = 42\\n>>> \\' I have spotted %d camels. \\' % camels\\n\\' I have spotted 42 camels. \\'\\nIf there is more than one format sequence in the string, the second argument has to be a\\ntuple. Each format sequence is matched with an element of the tuple, in order.\\nThe following example uses\\' %d \\' to format an integer,\\' %g \\' to format a ﬂoating-point num-\\nber (don’t ask why), and\\' %s \\' to format a string:\\n>>> \\' In %d years I have spotted %g %s. \\' % (3, 0.1, \\' camels \\' )\\n\\' In 3 years I have spotted 0.1 camels. \\'\\nThe number of elements in the tuple has to match the number of format sequences in the\\nstring. Also, the types of the elements have to match the format sequences:\\n>>> \\' %d %d %d \\' % (1, 2)\\nTypeError: not enough arguments for format string\\n>>> \\' %d \\' % \\' dollars \\'\\nTypeError: illegal argument type for built-in operation'),\n",

You can read more about it\\nat http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string- formatting .\\n14.4 Filenames and paths\\nFiles are organized into directories (also called “folders”). Every running program has a\\n“current directory,” which is the default directory for most operations. For example, when\\nyou open a ﬁle for reading, Python looks for it in the current directory.\\nThe os module provides functions for working with ﬁles and directories (“os” stands for\\n“operating system”). os.getcwd returns the name of the current directory:\\n>>> import os\\n>>> cwd = os.getcwd()\\n>>> print cwd\\n/home/dinsdale\\ncwd stands for “current working directory.” The result in this example is /home/dinsdale ,\\nwhich is the home directory of a user named dinsdale .\\nA string like cwd that identiﬁes a ﬁle is called a path. A relative path starts from the current\\ndirectory; an absolute path starts from the topmost directory in the ﬁle system.\\nThe paths we have seen so far are simple ﬁlenames, so they are relative to the current\\ndirectory. To ﬁnd the absolute path to a ﬁle, you can use os.path.abspath :\\n>>> os.path.abspath( ' memo.txt ' )\\n' /home/dinsdale/memo.txt '\\nos.path.exists checks whether a ﬁle or directory exists:\\n>>> os.path.exists( ' memo.txt ' )\\nTrue\\nIf it exists, os.path.isdir checks whether it’s a directory:\\n>>> os.path.isdir( ' memo.txt ' )\\nFalse\\n>>> os.path.isdir( ' music ' )\\nTrue\\nSimilarly, os.path.isfile checks whether it’s a ﬁle.\\nos.listdir returns a list of the ﬁles (and other directories) in the given directory:\\n>>> os.listdir(cwd)\\n[ ' music ' , ' photos ' , ' memo.txt ' ]\\nTo demonstrate these functions, the following example “walks” through a directory, prints\\nthe names of all the ﬁles, and calls itself recursively on all the directories.\\ndef walk(dirname):\\nfor name in os.listdir(dirname):\\npath = os.path.join(dirname, name)\"),\n",

If you try to open a ﬁle\\nthat doesn’t exist, you get anIOError :\\n>>> fin = open( ' bad_file ' )\\nIOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: ' bad_file '\\nIf you don’t have permission to access a ﬁle:\\n>>> fout = open( ' /etc/passwd ' , ' w ' )\\nIOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: ' /etc/passwd '\\nAnd if you try to open a directory for reading, you get\\n>>> fin = open( ' /home ' )\\nIOError: [Errno 21] Is a directory\\nTo avoid these errors, you could use functions like os.path.exists and os.path.isfile ,\\nbut it would take a lot of time and code to check all the possibilities (if “ Errno 21 ” is any\\nindication, there are at least 21 things that can go wrong).\\nIt is better to go ahead and try—and deal with problems if they happen—which is exactly\\nwhat the try statement does. The syntax is similar to an if statement:\\ntry:\\nfin = open( ' bad_file ' )\\nfor line in fin:\\nprint line\\nfin.close()\\nexcept:\\nprint ' Something went wrong. '\\nPython starts by executing the try clause. If all goes well, it skips the except clause and\\nproceeds. If an exception occurs, it jumps out of the try clause and executes the except\\nclause.\\nHandling an exception with a try statement is called catching an exception. In this exam-\\nple, the except clause prints an error message that is not very helpful. In general, catching\\nan exception gives you a chance to ﬁx the problem, or try again, or at least end the program\\ngracefully.\\nExercise 14.2. Write a function called sed that takes as arguments a pattern string, a replacement\\nstring, and two ﬁlenames; it should read the ﬁrst ﬁle and write the contents into the second ﬁle\\n(creating it if necessary). If the pattern string appears anywhere in the ﬁle, it should be replaced\\nwith the replacement string.\"),\n",

Most databases are organized like a\\ndictionary in the sense that they map from keys to values. The biggest difference is that the\\ndatabase is on disk (or other permanent storage), so it persists after the program ends.\\nThe module anydbm provides an interface for creating and updating database ﬁles. As an\\nexample, I’ll create a database that contains captions for image ﬁles.\\nOpening a database is similar to opening other ﬁles:\\n>>> import anydbm\\n>>> db = anydbm.open( ' captions.db ' , ' c ' )\\nThe mode ' c ' means that the database should be created if it doesn’t already exist. The\\nresult is a database object that can be used (for most operations) like a dictionary. If you\\ncreate a new item, anydbm updates the database ﬁle.\\n>>> db[ ' cleese.png ' ] = ' Photo of John Cleese. '\\nWhen you access one of the items, anydbm reads the ﬁle:\\n>>> print db[ ' cleese.png ' ]\\nPhoto of John Cleese.\\nIf you make another assignment to an existing key, anydbm replaces the old value:\\n>>> db[ ' cleese.png ' ] = ' Photo of John Cleese doing a silly walk. '\\n>>> print db[ ' cleese.png ' ]\\nPhoto of John Cleese doing a silly walk.\\nMany dictionary methods, like keys and items , also work with database objects. So does\\niteration with a for statement.\\nfor key in db:\\nprint key\\nAs with other ﬁles, you should close the database when you are done:\\n>>> db.close()\\n14.7 Pickling\\nA limitation of anydbm is that the keys and values have to be strings. If you try to use any\\nother type, you get an error.\\nThe pickle module can help. It translates almost any type of object into a string suitable\\nfor storage in a database, and then translates strings back into objects.\\npickle.dumps takes an object as a parameter and returns a string representation ( dumps is\\nshort for “dump string”):\"),\n",

Shells\\nusually provide commands to navigate the ﬁle system and launch applications. For exam-\\nple, in Unix you can change directories withcd , display the contents of a directory withls ,\\nand launch a web browser by typing (for example) firefox .\\nAny program that you can launch from the shell can also be launched from Python using\\na pipe. A pipe is an object that represents a running program.\\nFor example, the Unix command ls -l normally displays the contents of the current di-\\nrectory (in long format). You can launch ls with os.popen 1:\\n>>> cmd = ' ls -l '\\n>>> fp = os.popen(cmd)\\nThe argument is a string that contains a shell command. The return value is an object that\\nbehaves just like an open ﬁle. You can read the output from the ls process one line at a\\ntime with readline or get the whole thing at once with read :\\n1popen is deprecated now, which means we are supposed to stop using it and start using the subprocess\\nmodule. But for simple cases, I ﬁnd subprocess more complicated than necessary. So I am going to keep using\\npopen until they take it away.\"),\n",

As\\nan example, we will create a type called Point that represents a point in two-dimensional\\nspace.\\nIn mathematical notation, points are often written in parentheses with a comma separating\\nthe coordinates. For example, (0, 0) represents the origin, and (x, y) represents the point x\\nunits to the right and y units up from the origin.\\nThere are several ways we might represent points in Python:\\n• We could store the coordinates separately in two variables, x and y .\\n• We could store the coordinates as elements in a list or tuple.\\n• We could create a new type to represent points as objects.\\nCreating a new type is (a little) more complicated than the other options, but it has advan-\\ntages that will be apparent soon.\\nA user-deﬁned type is also called a class. A class deﬁnition looks like this:\\nclass Point(object):\\n\"\"\"Represents a point in 2-D space.\"\"\"\\nThis header indicates that the new class is a Point , which is a kind of object , which is a\\nbuilt-in type.\\nThe body is a docstring that explains what the class is for. You can deﬁne variables and\\nfunctions inside a class deﬁnition, but we will get back to that later.\\nDeﬁning a class named Point creates a class object.'),\n",

For example, imagine you are designing a class to represent rectangles.\\nWhat attributes would you use to specify the location and size of a rectangle? You can ig-\\nnore angle; to keep things simple, assume that the rectangle is either vertical or horizontal.\\nThere are at least two possibilities:\\n• You could specify one corner of the rectangle (or the center), the width, and the\\nheight.\\n• You could specify two opposing corners.\\nAt this point it is hard to say whether either is better than the other, so we’ll implement the\\nﬁrst one, just as an example.\\nHere is the class deﬁnition:\\nclass Rectangle(object):\\n\"\"\"Represents a rectangle.\\nattributes: width, height, corner.\\n\"\"\"\\nThe docstring lists the attributes: width and height are numbers; corner is a Point object\\nthat speciﬁes the lower-left corner.\\nTo represent a rectangle, you have to instantiate a Rectangle object and assign values to the\\nattributes:\\nbox = Rectangle()\\nbox.width = 100.0\\nbox.height = 200.0'),\n",

An object that is an attribute of another object is\\nembedded.\\n15.4 Instances as return values\\nFunctions can return instances. For example, find_center takes a Rectangle as an argu-\\nment and returns a Point that contains the coordinates of the center of the Rectangle :\\ndef find_center(rect):\\np = Point()\\np.x = rect.corner.x + rect.width/2.0\\np.y = rect.corner.y + rect.height/2.0\\nreturn p\\nHere is an example that passes box as an argument and assigns the resulting Point to\\ncenter :\\n>>> center = find_center(box)\\n>>> print_point(center)\\n(50.0, 100.0)\\n15.5 Objects are mutable\\nYou can change the state of an object by making an assignment to one of its attributes. For\\nexample, to change the size of a rectangle without changing its position, you can modify\\nthe values of width and height :\\nbox.width = box.width + 50\\nbox.height = box.width + 100\\nYou can also write functions that modify objects. For example, grow_rectangle takes a\\nRectangle object and two numbers, dwidth and dheight , and adds the numbers to the\\nwidth and height of the rectangle:\\ndef grow_rectangle(rect, dwidth, dheight):\\nrect.width += dwidth\\nrect.height += dheight'),\n",

It is hard to keep track of all the variables that might\\nrefer to a given object.\\nCopying an object is often an alternative to aliasing. The copy module contains a function\\ncalled copy that can duplicate any object:\\n>>> p1 = Point()\\n>>> p1.x = 3.0\\n>>> p1.y = 4.0\\n>>> import copy\\n>>> p2 = copy.copy(p1)\\np1 and p2 contain the same data, but they are not the same Point.\\n>>> print_point(p1)\\n(3.0, 4.0)\\n>>> print_point(p2)\\n(3.0, 4.0)\\n>>> p1 is p2\\nFalse\\n>>> p1 == p2\\nFalse\\nThe is operator indicates thatp1 and p2 are not the same object, which is what we expected.\\nBut you might have expected == to yield True because these points contain the same data.\\nIn that case, you will be disappointed to learn that for instances, the default behavior of the\\n== operator is the same as the is operator; it checks object identity, not object equivalence.\\nThis behavior can be changed—we’ll see how later.\\nIf you use copy.copy to duplicate a Rectangle, you will ﬁnd that it copies the Rectangle\\nobject but not the embedded Point.'),\n",

Write a correct version of increment that doesn’t contain any loops.\\nAnything that can be done with modiﬁers can also be done with pure functions. In fact,\\nsome programming languages only allow pure functions. There is some evidence that\\nprograms that use pure functions are faster to develop and less error-prone than programs\\nthat use modiﬁers.

Classes and functions\\n16.4 Prototyping versus planning\\nThe development plan I am demonstrating is called “prototype and patch.” For each func-\\ntion, I wrote a prototype that performed the basic calculation and then tested it, patching\\nerrors along the way.\\nThis approach can be effective, especially if you don’t yet have a deep understanding\\nof the problem. But incremental corrections can generate code that is unnecessarily\\ncomplicated—since it deals with many special cases—and unreliable—since it is hard to\\nknow if you have found all the errors.\\nAn alternative is planned development, in which high-level insight into the problem can\\nmake the programming much easier. In this case, the insight is that a Time object is really\\na three-digit number in base 60 (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal .)! The\\nsecond attribute is the “ones column,” theminute attribute is the “sixties column,” and the\\nhour attribute is the “thirty-six hundreds column.”\\nWhen we wrote add_time and increment , we were effectively doing addition in base 60,\\nwhich is why we had to carry from one column to the next.\\nThis observation suggests another approach to the whole problem—we can convert Time\\nobjects to integers and take advantage of the fact that the computer knows how to do\\ninteger arithmetic.\\nHere is a function that converts Times to integers:\\ndef time_to_int(time):\\nminutes = time.hour * 60 + time.minute\\nseconds = minutes * 60 + time.second\\nreturn seconds\\nAnd here is the function that converts integers to Times (recall thatdivmod divides the ﬁrst\\nargument by the second and returns the quotient and remainder as a tuple).\\ndef int_to_time(seconds):\\ntime = Time()\\nminutes, time.second = divmod(seconds, 60)\\ntime.hour, time.minute = divmod(minutes, 60)\\nreturn time\\nYou might have to think a bit, and run some tests, to convince yourself that these functions\\nare correct. One way to test them is to check thattime_to_int(int_to_time(x)) == x for\\nmany values of x . This is an example of a consistency check.\\nOnce you are convinced they are correct, you can use them to rewrite add_time :\\ndef add_time(t1, t2):\\nseconds = time_to_int(t1) + time_to_int(t2)\\nreturn int_to_time(seconds)\\nThis version is shorter than the original, and easier to verify.\\nExercise 16.5. Rewrite increment using time_to_int and int_to_time .\\nIn some ways, converting from base 60 to base 10 and back is harder than just dealing with\\ntimes. Base conversion is more abstract; our intuition for dealing with time values is better.\\nBut if we have the insight to treat times as base 60 numbers and make the investment of\\nwriting the conversion functions ( time_to_int and int_to_time ), we get a program that\\nis shorter, easier to read and debug, and more reliable.'),\n",

Debugging 155\\nIt is also easier to add features later. For example, imagine subtracting two Times to ﬁnd\\nthe duration between them. The naive approach would be to implement subtraction with\\nborrowing. Using the conversion functions would be easier and more likely to be correct.\\nIronically, sometimes making a problem harder (or more general) makes it easier (because\\nthere are fewer special cases and fewer opportunities for error).\\n16.5 Debugging\\nA Time object is well-formed if the values of minute and second are between 0 and 60\\n(including 0 but not 60) and if hour is positive. hour and minute should be integral values,\\nbut we might allow second to have a fraction part.\\nRequirements like these are called invariants because they should always be true. To put\\nit a different way, if they are not true, then something has gone wrong.\\nWriting code to check your invariants can help you detect errors and ﬁnd their causes. For\\nexample, you might have a function like valid_time that takes a Time object and returns\\nFalse if it violates an invariant:\\ndef valid_time(time):\\nif time.hour < 0 or time.minute < 0 or time.second < 0:\\nreturn False\\nif time.minute >= 60 or time.second >= 60:\\nreturn False\\nreturn True\\nThen at the beginning of each function you could check the arguments to make sure they\\nare valid:\\ndef add_time(t1, t2):\\nif not valid_time(t1) or not valid_time(t2):\\nraise ValueError( ' invalid Time object in add_time ' )\\nseconds = time_to_int(t1) + time_to_int(t2)\\nreturn int_to_time(seconds)\\nOr you could use an assert statement, which checks a given invariant and raises an ex-\\nception if it fails:\\ndef add_time(t1, t2):\\nassert valid_time(t1) and valid_time(t2)\\nseconds = time_to_int(t1) + time_to_int(t2)\\nreturn int_to_time(seconds)\\nassert statements are useful because they distinguish code that deals with normal condi-\\ntions from code that checks for errors.\\n16.6 Glossary\\nprototype and patch: A development plan that involves writing a rough draft of a pro-\\ngram, testing, and correcting errors as they are found.\\nplanned development: A development plan that involves high-level insight into the prob-\\nlem and more planning than incremental development or prototype development.\"),\n",

Similarly, the Point and Rectangle classes correspond to the mathematical\\nconcepts of a point and a rectangle.\\nSo far, we have not taken advantage of the features Python provides to support object-\\noriented programming. These features are not strictly necessary; most of them provide\\nalternative syntax for things we have already done. But in many cases, the alternative is\\nmore concise and more accurately conveys the structure of the program.\\nFor example, in the Time program, there is no obvious connection between the class deﬁ-\\nnition and the function deﬁnitions that follow. With some examination, it is apparent that\\nevery function takes at least one Time object as an argument.\\nThis observation is the motivation for methods; a method is a function that is associated\\nwith a particular class. We have seen methods for strings, lists, dictionaries and tuples. In\\nthis chapter, we will deﬁne methods for user-deﬁned types.\\nMethods are semantically the same as functions, but there are two syntactic differences:'),\n",

Classes and methods\\n• Methods are deﬁned inside a class deﬁnition in order to make the relationship be-\\ntween the class and the method explicit.\\n• The syntax for invoking a method is different from the syntax for calling a function.\\nIn the next few sections, we will take the functions from the previous two chapters and\\ntransform them into methods. This transformation is purely mechanical; you can do it\\nsimply by following a sequence of steps. If you are comfortable converting from one form\\nto another, you will be able to choose the best form for whatever you are doing.\\n17.2 Printing objects\\nIn Chapter 16, we deﬁned a class named Time and in Exercise 16.1, you wrote a function\\nnamed print_time :\\nclass Time(object):\\n\"\"\"Represents the time of day.\"\"\"\\ndef print_time(time):\\nprint \\' %.2d:%.2d:%.2d \\' % (time.hour, time.minute, time.second)\\nTo call this function, you have to pass a Time object as an argument:\\n>>> start = Time()\\n>>> start.hour = 9\\n>>> start.minute = 45\\n>>> start.second = 00\\n>>> print_time(start)\\n09:45:00\\nTo makeprint_time a method, all we have to do is move the function deﬁnition inside the\\nclass deﬁnition. Notice the change in indentation.\\nclass Time(object):\\ndef print_time(time):\\nprint \\' %.2d:%.2d:%.2d \\' % (time.hour, time.minute, time.second)\\nNow there are two ways to call print_time . The ﬁrst (and less common) way is to use\\nfunction syntax:\\n>>> Time.print_time(start)\\n09:45:00\\nIn this use of dot notation, Time is the name of the class, andprint_time is the name of the\\nmethod. start is passed as a parameter.\\nThe second (and more concise) way is to use method syntax:\\n>>> start.print_time()\\n09:45:00\\nIn this use of dot notation, print_time is the name of the method (again), and start is\\nthe object the method is invoked on, which is called the subject. Just as the subject of\\na sentence is what the sentence is about, the subject of a method invocation is what the\\nmethod is about.\\nInside the method, the subject is assigned to the ﬁrst parameter, so in this case start is\\nassigned to time .'),\n",

Another example 159\\nBy convention, the ﬁrst parameter of a method is calledself , so it would be more common\\nto write print_time like this:\\nclass Time(object):\\ndef print_time(self):\\nprint ' %.2d:%.2d:%.2d ' % (self.hour, self.minute, self.second)\\nThe reason for this convention is an implicit metaphor:\\n• The syntax for a function call, print_time(start) , suggests that the function is the\\nactive agent. It says something like, “Hey print_time ! Here’s an object for you to\\nprint.”\\n• In object-oriented programming, the objects are the active agents. A method invoca-\\ntion like start.print_time() says “Hey start ! Please print yourself.”\\nThis change in perspective might be more polite, but it is not obvious that it is useful. In the\\nexamples we have seen so far, it may not be. But sometimes shifting responsibility from the\\nfunctions onto the objects makes it possible to write more versatile functions, and makes it\\neasier to maintain and reuse code.\\nExercise 17.1. Rewrite time_to_int (from Section 16.4) as a method. It is probably not appro-\\npriate to rewrite int_to_time as a method; what object you would invoke it on?\\n17.3 Another example\\nHere’s a version ofincrement (from Section 16.3) rewritten as a method:\\n# inside class Time:\\ndef increment(self, seconds):\\nseconds += self.time_to_int()\\nreturn int_to_time(seconds)\\nThis version assumes that time_to_int is written as a method, as in Exercise 17.1. Also,\\nnote that it is a pure function, not a modiﬁer.\\nHere’s how you would invokeincrement :\\n>>> start.print_time()\\n09:45:00\\n>>> end = start.increment(1337)\\n>>> end.print_time()\\n10:07:17\\nThe subject, start , gets assigned to the ﬁrst parameter, self . The argument, 1337 , gets\\nassigned to the second parameter, seconds .\\nThis mechanism can be confusing, especially if you make an error. For example, if you\\ninvoke increment with two arguments, you get:\\n>>> end = start.increment(1337, 460)\\nTypeError: increment() takes exactly 2 arguments (3 given)\\nThe error message is initially confusing, because there are only two arguments in paren-\\ntheses.

Otherwise it assumes that the param-\\neter is a number and invokes increment . This operation is called a type-based dispatch\\nbecause it dispatches the computation to different methods based on the type of the argu-\\nments.\\nHere are examples that use the + operator with different types:\\n>>> start = Time(9, 45)\\n>>> duration = Time(1, 35)\\n>>> print start + duration\\n11:20:00\\n>>> print start + 1337\\n10:07:17\\nUnfortunately, this implementation of addition is not commutative.

Often you can avoid it by writing functions that work correctly for arguments with\\ndifferent types.\\nMany of the functions we wrote for strings will actually work for any kind of sequence.\\nFor example, in Section 11.1 we used histogram to count the number of times each letter\\nappears in a word.\\ndef histogram(s):\\nd = dict()\\nfor c in s:\\nif c not in d:\\nd[c] = 1\\nelse:\\nd[c] = d[c]+1\\nreturn d\\nThis function also works for lists, tuples, and even dictionaries, as long as the elements of\\ns are hashable, so they can be used as keys in d .\\n>>> t = [ ' spam ' , ' egg ' , ' spam ' , ' spam ' , ' bacon ' , ' spam ' ]\\n>>> histogram(t)\\n{ ' bacon ' : 1, ' egg ' : 1, ' spam ' : 4}\\nFunctions that can work with several types are called polymorphic. Polymorphism can\\nfacilitate code reuse. For example, the built-in function sum , which adds the elements of a\\nsequence, works as long as the elements of the sequence support addition.\\nSince Time objects provide an add method, they work with sum :\\n>>> t1 = Time(7, 43)\\n>>> t2 = Time(7, 41)\\n>>> t3 = Time(7, 37)\\n>>> total = sum([t1, t2, t3])\\n>>> print total\\n23:01:00\\nIn general, if all of the operations inside a function work with a given type, then the func-\\ntion works with that type.\\nThe best kind of polymorphism is the unintentional kind, where you discover that a func-\\ntion you already wrote can be applied to a type you never planned for.\"),\n",

Classes and methods\\n17.10 Debugging\\nIt is legal to add attributes to objects at any point in the execution of a program, but if you\\nare a stickler for type theory, it is a dubious practice to have objects of the same type with\\ndifferent attribute sets. It is usually a good idea to initialize all of an object’s attributes in\\nthe init method.\\nIf you are not sure whether an object has a particular attribute, you can use the built-in\\nfunction hasattr (see Section 15.7).\\nAnother way to access the attributes of an object is through the special attribute __dict__ ,\\nwhich is a dictionary that maps attribute names (as strings) and values:\\n>>> p = Point(3, 4)\\n>>> print p.__dict__\\n{ ' y ' : 4, ' x ' : 3}\\nFor purposes of debugging, you might ﬁnd it useful to keep this function handy:\\ndef print_attributes(obj):\\nfor attr in obj.__dict__:\\nprint attr, getattr(obj, attr)\\nprint_attributes traverses the items in the object’s dictionary and prints each attribute\\nname and its corresponding value.\\nThe built-in functiongetattr takes an object and an attribute name (as a string) and returns\\nthe attribute’s value.\\n17.11 Interface and implementation\\nOne of the goals of object-oriented design is to make software more maintainable, which\\nmeans that you can keep the program working when other parts of the system change, and\\nmodify the program to meet new requirements.\\nA design principle that helps achieve that goal is to keep interfaces separate from imple-\\nmentations. For objects, that means that the methods a class provides should not depend\\non how the attributes are represented.\\nFor example, in this chapter we developed a class that represents a time of day. Methods\\nprovided by this class include time_to_int , is_after , and add_time .\\nWe could implement those methods in several ways. The details of the implementation\\ndepend on how we represent time. In this chapter, the attributes of a Time object are hour ,\\nminute , and second .\\nAs an alternative, we could replace these attributes with a single integer representing the\\nnumber of seconds since midnight. This implementation would make some methods, like\\nis_after , easier to write, but it makes some methods harder.\\nAfter you deploy a new class, you might discover a better implementation. If other parts\\nof the program are using your class, it might be time-consuming and error-prone to change\\nthe interface.\\nBut if you designed the interface carefully, you can change the implementation without\\nchanging the interface, which means that other parts of the program don’t have to change.\"),\n",

The suits are Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, and Clubs (in descending order in\\nbridge). The ranks are Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, and King. Depending on\\nthe game that you are playing, an Ace may be higher than King or lower than 2.\\nIf we want to deﬁne a new object to represent a playing card, it is obvious what the at-\\ntributes should be: rank and suit . It is not as obvious what type the attributes should be.\\nOne possibility is to use strings containing words like ' Spade ' for suits and ' Queen ' for\\nranks. One problem with this implementation is that it would not be easy to compare cards\\nto see which had a higher rank or suit.\\nAn alternative is to use integers to encode the ranks and suits. In this context, “encode”\\nmeans that we are going to deﬁne a mapping between numbers and suits, or between\\nnumbers and ranks. This kind of encoding is not meant to be a secret (that would be\\n“encryption”).\\nFor example, this table shows the suits and the corresponding integer codes:\\nSpades ↦→ 3\\nHearts ↦→ 2\\nDiamonds ↦→ 1\\nClubs ↦→ 0\\nThis code makes it easy to compare cards; because higher suits map to higher numbers, we\\ncan compare suits by comparing their codes.\"),\n",

A natural way to do that is\\nwith lists of strings. We assign these lists to class attributes:\\n# inside class Card:\\nsuit_names = [ \\' Clubs \\' , \\' Diamonds \\' , \\' Hearts \\' , \\' Spades \\' ]\\nrank_names = [None, \\' Ace \\' , \\' 2 \\' , \\' 3 \\' , \\' 4 \\' , \\' 5 \\' , \\' 6 \\' , \\' 7 \\' ,\\n\\' 8 \\' , \\' 9 \\' , \\' 10 \\' , \\' Jack \\' , \\' Queen \\' , \\' King \\' ]\\ndef __str__(self):\\nreturn \\' %s of %s \\' % (Card.rank_names[self.rank],\\nCard.suit_names[self.suit])\\nVariables like suit_names and rank_names , which are deﬁned inside a class but outside\\nof any method, are called class attributes because they are associated with the class object\\nCard .\\nThis term distinguishes them from variables like suit and rank , which are called instance\\nattributes because they are associated with a particular instance.\\nBoth kinds of attribute are accessed using dot notation. For example, in __str__ , self\\nis a Card object, and self.rank is its rank. Similarly, Card is a class object, and\\nCard.rank_names is a list of strings associated with the class.\\nEvery card has its own suit and rank , but there is only one copy of suit_names and\\nrank_names .'),\n",

In order to\\ncompare cards, you have to decide whether rank or suit is more important.\\nThe answer might depend on what game you are playing, but to keep things simple, we’ll\\nmake the arbitrary choice that suit is more important, so all of the Spades outrank all of the\\nDiamonds, and so on.\\nWith that decided, we can write __cmp__ :\"),\n",

Inheritance is the ability to deﬁne a new class that is a modiﬁed version of an\\nexisting class.\\nIt is called “inheritance” because the new class inherits the methods of the existing class.\\nExtending this metaphor, the existing class is called the parent and the new class is called\\nthe child.\\nAs an example, let’s say we want a class to represent a “hand,” that is, the set of cards held\\nby one player. A hand is similar to a deck: both are made up of a set of cards, and both\\nrequire operations like adding and removing cards.\\nA hand is also different from a deck; there are operations we want for hands that don’t\\nmake sense for a deck. For example, in poker we might compare two hands to see which\\none wins. In bridge, we might compute a score for a hand in order to make a bid.\\nThis relationship between classes—similar, but different—lends itself to inheritance.\\nThe deﬁnition of a child class is like other class deﬁnitions, but the name of the parent class\\nappears in parentheses:\\nclass Hand(Deck):\\n\"\"\"Represents a hand of playing cards.\"\"\"\\nThis deﬁnition indicates that Hand inherits from Deck ; that means we can use methods like\\npop_card and add_card for Hands as well as Decks.\\nHand also inherits __init__ from Deck , but it doesn’t really do what we want: instead of\\npopulating the hand with 52 new cards, the init method for Hands should initialize cards\\nwith an empty list.\\nIf we provide an init method in the Hand class, it overrides the one in the Deck class:\\n# inside class Hand:\\ndef __init__(self, label= \\'\\' ):\\nself.cards = []\\nself.label = label'),\n",

Write a Deck method called deal_hands that takes two parameters, the number of\\nhands and the number of cards per hand, and that creates new Hand objects, deals the appropriate\\nnumber of cards per hand, and returns a list of Hand objects.\\nInheritance is a useful feature.

When a method is\\ninvoked, it is sometimes not clear where to ﬁnd its deﬁnition. The relevant code may\\nbe scattered among several modules. Also, many of the things that can be done using\\ninheritance can be done as well or better without it.\\n18.8 Class diagrams\\nSo far we have seen stack diagrams, which show the state of a program, and object dia-\\ngrams, which show the attributes of an object and their values. These diagrams represent\\na snapshot in the execution of a program, so they change as the program runs.\\nThey are also highly detailed; for some purposes, too detailed. A class diagram is a more\\nabstract representation of the structure of a program. Instead of showing individual ob-\\njects, it shows classes and the relationships between them.\"),\n",

Inheritance\\nHand\\nDeck * Card\\nFigure 18.2: Class diagram.\\nThere are several kinds of relationship between classes:\\n• Objects in one class might contain references to objects in another class. For example,\\neach Rectangle contains a reference to a Point, and each Deck contains references to\\nmany Cards. This kind of relationship is called HAS-A, as in, “a Rectangle has a\\nPoint.”\\n• One class might inherit from another. This relationship is called IS-A, as in, “a Hand\\nis a kind of a Deck.”\\n• One class might depend on another in the sense that changes in one class would\\nrequire changes in the other.\\nA class diagram is a graphical representation of these relationships. For example, Fig-\\nure 18.2 shows the relationships between Card , Deck and Hand .\\nThe arrow with a hollow triangle head represents an IS-A relationship; in this case it indi-\\ncates that Hand inherits from Deck.\\nThe standard arrow head represents a HAS-A relationship; in this case a Deck has refer-\\nences to Card objects.\\nThe star (* ) near the arrow head is amultiplicity; it indicates how many Cards a Deck has.\\nA multiplicity can be a simple number, like 52 , a range, like 5..7 or a star, which indicates\\nthat a Deck can have any number of Cards.\\nA more detailed diagram might show that a Deck actually contains a list of Cards, but\\nbuilt-in types like list and dict are usually not included in class diagrams.\\nExercise 18.4. Read TurtleWorld.py , World.py and Gui.py and draw a class diagram that\\nshows the relationships among the classes deﬁned there.\\n18.9 Debugging\\nInheritance can make debugging a challenge because when you invoke a method on an\\nobject, you might not know which method will be invoked.\\nSuppose you are writing a function that works with Hand objects. You would like it to\\nwork with all kinds of Hands, like PokerHands, BridgeHands, etc. If you invoke a method\\nlike shuffle , you might get the one deﬁned in Deck , but if any of the subclasses override\\nthis method, you’ll get that version instead.\\nAny time you are unsure about the ﬂow of execution through your program, the sim-\\nplest solution is to add print statements at the beginning of the relevant methods.

It should take the same parameters, return the\\nsame type, and obey the same preconditions and postconditions.

In each case there is an obvious correspondence between the object and some\\nentity in the real world (or at least a mathematical world).\\nBut sometimes it is less obvious what objects you need and how they should interact. In\\nthat case you need a different development plan. In the same way that we discovered\\nfunction interfaces by encapsulation and generalization, we can discover class interfaces\\nby data encapsulation.\\nMarkov analysis, from Section 13.8, provides a good example. If you download my\\ncode from http://thinkpython.com/code/markov.py , you’ll see that it uses two global\\nvariables— suffix_map and prefix —that are read and written from several functions.\\nsuffix_map = {}\\nprefix = ()\\nBecause these variables are global we can only run one analysis at a time. If we read two\\ntexts, their preﬁxes and sufﬁxes would be added to the same data structures (which makes\\nfor some interesting generated text).\\nTo run multiple analyses, and keep them separate, we can encapsulate the state of each\\nanalysis in an object.

Each has pros and cons, which is why Python has not converged on a\\nstandard.\\nThe one I will present in this chapter is Tkinter because I think it is the easiest to get started\\nwith. Most of the concepts in this chapter apply to the other GUI modules, too.\\nThere are several books and web pages about Tkinter. One of the best online resources is\\nAn Introduction to Tkinter by Fredrik Lundh.\\nI have written a module called Gui.py that comes with Swampy. It provides a simpliﬁed\\ninterface to the functions and classes in Tkinter. The examples in this chapter are based on\\nthis module.\\nHere is a simple example that creates and displays a Gui:\\nTo create a GUI, you have to import Gui from Swampy:\\nfrom swampy.Gui import *\\nOr, depending on how you installed Swampy, like this:\\nfrom Gui import *\\nThen instantiate a Gui object:\\ng = Gui()\\ng.title( ' Gui ' )\\ng.mainloop()\\nWhen you run this code, a window should appear with an empty gray square and the\\ntitle Gui . mainloop runs the event loop, which waits for the user to do something and\"),\n",

It is an inﬁnite loop; it runs until the user closes the window, or\\npresses Control-C, or does something that causes the program to quit.\\nThis Gui doesn’t do much because it doesn’t have anywidgets. Widgets are the elements\\nthat make up a GUI; they include:\\nButton: A widget, containing text or an image, that performs an action when pressed.\\nCanvas: A region that can display lines, rectangles, circles and other shapes.\\nEntry: A region where users can type text.\\nScrollbar: A widget that controls the visible part of another widget.\\nFrame: A container, often invisible, that contains other widgets.\\nThe empty gray square you see when you create a Gui is a Frame. When you create a new\\nwidget, it is added to this Frame.\\n19.2 Buttons and callbacks\\nThe method bu creates a Button widget:\\nbutton = g.bu(text= ' Press me. ' )\\nThe return value from bu is a Button object. The button that appears in the Frame is a\\ngraphical representation of this object; you can control the button by invoking methods on\\nit.\\nbu takes up to 32 parameters that control the appearance and function of the button. These\\nparameters are called options. Instead of providing values for all 32 options, you can use\\nkeyword arguments, like text= ' Press me. ' , to specify only the options you need and use\\nthe default values for the rest.\\nWhen you add a widget to the Frame, it gets “shrink-wrapped;” that is, the Frame shrinks\\nto the size of the Button. If you add more widgets, the Frame grows to accommodate them.\\nThe method la creates a Label widget:\\nlabel = g.la(text= ' Press the button. ' )\\nBy default, Tkinter stacks the widgets top-to-bottom and centers them. We’ll see how to\\noverride that behavior soon.\\nIf you press the button, you will see that it doesn’t do much. That’s because you haven’t\\n“wired it up;” that is, you haven’t told it what to do!\\nThe option that controls the behavior of a button is command . The value of command is a\\nfunction that gets executed when the button is pressed. For example, here is a function\\nthat creates a new Label:\\ndef make_label():\\ng.la(text= ' Thank you.

User actions, like but-\\nton presses and key strokes, are called events. In event-driven programming, the ﬂow of\\nexecution is determined by user actions rather than by the programmer.\\nThe challenge of event-driven programming is to construct a set of widgets and callbacks\\nthat work correctly (or at least generate appropriate error messages) for any sequence of\\nuser actions.\\nExercise 19.1.

If you did Exercise 15.4 you are already familiar with canvases.\\nThe method ca creates a new Canvas:\\ncanvas = g.ca(width=500, height=500)\\nwidth and height are the dimensions of the canvas in pixels.\\nAfter you create a widget, you can still change the values of the options with the config\\nmethod. For example, the bg option changes the background color:\\ncanvas.config(bg= ' white ' )\\nThe value of bg is a string that names a color. The set of legal color names is different for\\ndifferent implementations of Python, but all implementations provide at least:\\nwhite black\\nred green blue\\ncyan yellow magenta\\nShapes on a Canvas are called items. For example, the Canvas method circle draws (you\\nguessed it) a circle:\\nitem = canvas.circle([0,0], 100, fill= ' red ' )\\nThe ﬁrst argument is a coordinate pair that speciﬁes the center of the circle; the second is\\nthe radius.\\nGui.py provides a standard Cartesian coordinate system with the origin at the center of\\nthe Canvas and the positive y axis pointing up. This is different from some other graphics\\nsystems where the origin is in the upper left corner, with the y axis pointing down.\\nThe fill option speciﬁes that the circle should be ﬁlled in with red.\\nThe return value from circle is an Item object that provides methods for modifying the\\nitem on the canvas. For example, you can use config to change any of the circle’s options:\"),\n",

Use config to modify the existing circle; don’t create a\\nnew one.\\nYour program should handle the case where the user tries to change the color of a circle that hasn’t\\nbeen created, and the case where the color name is invalid.\\nYou can see my solution at http: // thinkpython. com/ code/ circle_ demo. py .\\n19.6 Packing widgets\\nSo far we have been stacking widgets in a single column, but in most GUIs the layout is\\nmore complicated.

You can download the complete example from http://thinkpython.com/code/\\nSimpleTurtleWorld.py .\\nAt the top level, this GUI contains two widgets—a Canvas and a Frame—arranged in a\\nrow. So the ﬁrst step is to create the row.\\nclass SimpleTurtleWorld(TurtleWorld):\\n\"\"\"This class is identical to TurtleWorld, but the code that\\nlays out the GUI is simplified for explanatory purposes.\"\"\"\\ndef setup(self):\\nself.row()\\n...\\nsetup is the function that creates and arranges the widgets.

For example, when you press a button, the default\\nbinding changes the relief of the button to make it look depressed. When you release the\\nbutton, the binding restores the appearance of the button and invokes the callback speciﬁed\\nwith the command option.\\nYou can use the bind method to override these default bindings or to add new ones. For\\nexample, this code creates a binding for a canvas (you can download the code in this section\\nfrom http://thinkpython.com/code/draggable_demo.py ):\\nca.bind( ' <ButtonPress-1> ' , make_circle)\\nThe ﬁrst argument is an event string; this event is triggered when the user presses\\nthe left mouse button. Other mouse events include ButtonMotion , ButtonRelease and\\nDouble-Button .\\nThe second argument is an event handler. An event handler is a function or bound method,\\nlike a callback, but an important difference is that an event handler takes an Event object\\nas a parameter. Here is an example:\\ndef make_circle(event):\\npos = ca.canvas_coords([event.x, event.y])\\nitem = ca.circle(pos, 5, fill= ' red ' )\"),\n",

Binding 187\\nThe Event object contains information about the type of event and details like the coordi-\\nnates of the mouse pointer. In this example the information we need is the location of the\\nmouse click. These values are in “pixel coordinates,” which are deﬁned by the underlying\\ngraphical system. The method canvas_coords translates them to “Canvas coordinates,”\\nwhich are compatible with Canvas methods like circle .\\nFor Entry widgets, it is common to bind the <Return> event, which is triggered when the\\nuser presses the Return or Enter key. For example, the following code creates a Button and\\nan Entry.\\nbu = g.bu( ' Make text item: ' , make_text)\\nen = g.en()\\nen.bind( ' <Return> ' , make_text)\\nmake_text is called when the Button is pressed or when the user hits Return while typing\\nin the Entry.

When you press the button, it does nothing because the return value from\\nthe_callback is None . Usually you do not want to invoke a callback while you are setting\\nup the GUI; it should only be invoked later in response to a user event.\\nAnother challenge of GUI programming is that you don’t have control of the ﬂow of exe-\\ncution. Which parts of the program execute and their order are determined by user actions.\\nThat means that you have to design your program to work correctly for any possible se-\\nquence of events.\\nFor example, the GUI in Exercise 19.3 has two widgets: one creates a Circle item and the\\nother changes the color of the Circle.

In the example, the user can press either of the\\nbuttons, or quit.\\n• For each state-event pair, what is the desired outcome? Since there are two states and\\ntwo buttons, there are four state-event pairs to consider.\\n• What can cause a transition from one state to another? In this case, there is a transition\\nwhen the user creates the ﬁrst circle.\\nYou might also ﬁnd it useful to deﬁne, and check, invariants that should hold regardless of\\nthe sequence of events.\\nThis approach to GUI programming can help you write correct code without taking the\\ntime to test every possible sequence of user events!\\n19.10 Glossary\\nGUI: A graphical user interface.\\nwidget: One of the elements that makes up a GUI, including buttons, menus, text entry\\nﬁelds, etc.\\noption: A value that controls the appearance or function of a widget.\\nkeyword argument: An argument that indicates the parameter name as part of the func-\\ntion call.\\ncallback: A function associated with a widget that is called when the user performs an\\naction.\\nbound method: A method associated with a particular instance.\\nevent-driven programming: A style of programming in which the ﬂow of execution is\\ndetermined by user actions.\\nevent: A user action, like a mouse click or key press, that causes a GUI to respond.\\nevent loop: An inﬁnite loop that waits for user actions and responds.\\nitem: A graphical element on a Canvas widget.\\nbounding box: A rectangle that encloses a set of items, usually speciﬁed by two opposing\\ncorners.\\npack: To arrange and display the elements of a GUI.\\ngeometry manager: A system for packing widgets.\\nbinding: An association between a widget, an event, and an event handler.

Most runtime error messages include information about where\\nthe error occurred and what functions were executing. Example: An inﬁnite recur-\\nsion eventually causes the runtime error “maximum recursion depth exceeded.”\\n• Semantic errors are problems with a program that runs without producing error mes-\\nsages but doesn’t do the right thing.

In the second case, it might not\\nproduce an error message at all!\\n5. An unclosed opening operator— ( , { , or [ —makes Python continue with the next line\\nas part of the current statement. Generally, an error occurs almost immediately in the\\nnext line.\\n6. Check for the classic = instead of == inside a conditional.\\n7. Check the indentation to make sure it lines up the way it is supposed to. Python\\ncan handle space and tabs, but if you mix them it can cause problems.

Check your programming environment to\\nmake sure that the program you are editing is the one Python is trying to run.\\nIf you are not sure, try putting an obvious and deliberate syntax error at the beginning of\\nthe program. Now run it again. If the interpreter doesn’t ﬁnd the new error, you are not\\nrunning the new code.\\nThere are a few likely culprits:\\n• You edited the ﬁle and forgot to save the changes before running it again. Some\\nprogramming environments do this for you, but some don’t.\\n• You changed the name of the ﬁle, but you are still running the old name.\\n• Something in your development environment is conﬁgured incorrectly.'),\n",

Debugging\\nTo simplify the program, there are several things you can do. First, scale down the problem\\nthe program is working on. For example, if you are searching a list, search a small list. If\\nthe program takes input from the user, give it the simplest input that causes the problem.\\nSecond, clean up the program. Remove dead code and reorganize the program to make\\nit as easy to read as possible. For example, if you suspect that the problem is in a deeply\\nnested part of the program, try rewriting that part with simpler structure. If you suspect a\\nlarge function, try splitting it into smaller functions and testing them separately.\\nOften the process of ﬁnding the minimal test case leads you to the bug. If you ﬁnd that\\na program works in one situation but not in another, that gives you a clue about what is\\ngoing on.\\nSimilarly, rewriting a piece of code can help you ﬁnd subtle bugs. If you make a change\\nthat you think shouldn’t affect the program, and it does, that can tip you off.\\nA.3 Semantic errors\\nIn some ways, semantic errors are the hardest to debug, because the interpreter provides\\nno information about what is wrong. Only you know what the program is supposed to do.\\nThe ﬁrst step is to make a connection between the program text and the behavior you are\\nseeing. You need a hypothesis about what the program is actually doing. One of the things\\nthat makes that hard is that computers run so fast.\\nYou will often wish that you could slow the program down to human speed, and with\\nsome debuggers you can. But the time it takes to insert a few well-placedprint statements\\nis often short compared to setting up the debugger, inserting and removing breakpoints,\\nand “stepping” the program to where the error is occurring.\\nA.3.1 My program doesn’t work.\\nYou should ask yourself these questions:\\n• Is there something the program was supposed to do but which doesn’t seem to be\\nhappening? Find the section of the code that performs that function and make sure\\nit is executing when you think it should.\\n• Is something happening that shouldn’t? Find code in your program that performs\\nthat function and see if it is executing when it shouldn’t.\\n• Is a section of code producing an effect that is not what you expected? Make sure that\\nyou understand the code in question, especially if it involves invocations to functions\\nor methods in other Python modules. Read the documentation for the functions you\\ninvoke. Try them out by writing simple test cases and checking the results.\\nIn order to program, you need to have a mental model of how programs work. If you write\\na program that doesn’t do what you expect, very often the problem is not in the program;\\nit’s in your mental model.'),\n",

Once you\\nﬁnd the discrepancy between your model and reality, you can solve the problem.\\nOf course, you should be building and testing components as you develop the program.\\nIf you encounter a problem, there should be only a small amount of new code that is not\\nknown to be correct.\\nA.3.2 I’ve got a big hairy expression and it doesn’t do what I expect.\\nWriting complex expressions is ﬁne as long as they are readable, but they can be hard to\\ndebug. It is often a good idea to break a complex expression into a series of assignments to\\ntemporary variables.\\nFor example:\\nself.hands[i].addCard(self.hands[self.findNeighbor(i)].popCard())\\nThis can be rewritten as:\\nneighbor = self.findNeighbor(i)\\npickedCard = self.hands[neighbor].popCard()\\nself.hands[i].addCard(pickedCard)\\nThe explicit version is easier to read because the variable names provide additional docu-\\nmentation, and it is easier to debug because you can check the types of the intermediate\\nvariables and display their values.\\nAnother problem that can occur with big expressions is that the order of evaluation may\\nnot be what you expect. For example, if you are translating the expression x\\n2π into Python,\\nyou might write:\\ny = x / 2 * math.pi\\nThat is not correct because multiplication and division have the same precedence and are\\nevaluated from left to right. So this expression computes xπ/2.\\nA good way to debug expressions is to add parentheses to make the order of evaluation\\nexplicit:\\ny = x / (2 * math.pi)\\nWhenever you are not sure of the order of evaluation, use parentheses. Not only will the\\nprogram be correct (in the sense of doing what you intended), it will also be more readable\\nfor other people who haven’t memorized the rules of precedence.\\nA.3.3 I’ve got a function or method that doesn’t return what I expect.\\nIf you have areturn statement with a complex expression, you don’t have a chance to print\\nthe return value before returning. Again, you can use a temporary variable. For example,\\ninstead of:\\nreturn self.hands[i].removeMatches()\\nyou could write:\\ncount = self.hands[i].removeMatches()\\nreturn count\\nNow you have the opportunity to display the value of count before returning.'),\n",

Your program should be as\\nsimple as possible, and you should be working on the smallest input that causes the error.\\nYou should have print statements in the appropriate places (and the output they produce\\nshould be comprehensible). You should understand the problem well enough to describe\\nit concisely.\\nWhen you bring someone in to help, be sure to give them the information they need:\\n• If there is an error message, what is it and what part of the program does it indicate?\\n• What was the last thing you did before this error occurred? What were the last lines\\nof code that you wrote, or what is the new test case that fails?\\n• What have you tried so far, and what have you learned?\\nWhen you ﬁnd the bug, take a second to think about what you could have done to ﬁnd it\\nfaster.

When you are done with this book,\\nyou might want to move on to that one.\\nAnalysis of algorithms is a branch of computer science that studies the performance of\\nalgorithms, especially their run time and space requirements. See http://en.wikipedia.\\norg/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms .\\nThe practical goal of algorithm analysis is to predict the performance of different algo-\\nrithms in order to guide design decisions.\\nDuring the 2008 United States Presidential Campaign, candidate Barack Obama was asked\\nto perform an impromptu analysis when he visited Google. Chief executive Eric Schmidt\\njokingly asked him for “the most efﬁcient way to sort a million 32-bit integers.” Obama\\nhad apparently been tipped off, because he quickly replied, “I think the bubble sort would\\nbe the wrong way to go.” See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4RRi_ntQc8 .\\nThis is true: bubble sort is conceptually simple but slow for large datasets. The an-\\nswer Schmidt was probably looking for is “radix sort” (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\\nRadix_sort )1.\\nThe goal of algorithm analysis is to make meaningful comparisons between algorithms,\\nbut there are some problems:\\n• The relative performance of the algorithms might depend on characteristics of the\\nhardware, so one algorithm might be faster on Machine A, another on Machine B.\\nThe general solution to this problem is to specify a machine model and analyze the\\nnumber of steps, or operations, an algorithm requires under a given model.\\n• Relative performance might depend on the details of the dataset. For example, some\\nsorting algorithms run faster if the data are already partially sorted; other algorithms\\n1 But if you get a question like this in an interview, I think a better answer is, “The fastest way to sort a million\\nintegers is to use whatever sort function is provided by the language I’m using. Its performance is good enough\\nfor the vast majority of applications, but if it turned out that my application was too slow, I would use a proﬁler\\nto see where the time was being spent. If it looked like a faster sort algorithm would have a signiﬁcant effect on\\nperformance, then I would look around for a good implementation of radix sort.”'),\n",

Analysis of Algorithms\\nrun slower in this case. A common way to avoid this problem is to analyze theworst\\ncase scenario. It is sometimes useful to analyze average case performance, but that’s\\nusually harder, and it might not be obvious what set of cases to average over.\\n• Relative performance also depends on the size of the problem. A sorting algorithm\\nthat is fast for small lists might be slow for long lists. The usual solution to this\\nproblem is to express run time (or number of operations) as a function of problem\\nsize, and to compare the functions asymptotically as the problem size increases.\\nThe good thing about this kind of comparison that it lends itself to simple classiﬁcation of\\nalgorithms. For example, if I know that the run time of Algorithm A tends to be propor-\\ntional to the size of the input, n, and Algorithm B tends to be proportional to n2, then I\\nexpect A to be faster than B for large values of n.\\nThis kind of analysis comes with some caveats, but we’ll get to that later.\\nB.1 Order of growth\\nSuppose you have analyzed two algorithms and expressed their run times in terms of the\\nsize of the input: Algorithm A takes 100 n + 1 steps to solve a problem with size n; Algo-\\nrithm B takes n2 + n + 1 steps.\\nThe following table shows the run time of these algorithms for different problem sizes:\\nInput Run time of Run time of\\nsize Algorithm A Algorithm B\\n10 1 001 111\\n100 10 001 10 101\\n1 000 100 001 1 001 001\\n10 000 1 000 001 > 1010\\nAt n = 10, Algorithm A looks pretty bad; it takes almost 10 times longer than Algorithm\\nB. But for n = 100 they are about the same, and for larger values A is much better.\\nThe fundamental reason is that for large values of n, any function that contains an n2 term\\nwill grow faster than a function whose leading term isn. The leading term is the term with\\nthe highest exponent.\\nFor Algorithm A, the leading term has a large coefﬁcient, 100, which is why B does better\\nthan A for small n. But regardless of the coefﬁcients, there will always be some value of n\\nwhere an2 > bn.\\nThe same argument applies to the non-leading terms. Even if the run time of Algorithm A\\nwere n + 1000000, it would still be better than Algorithm B for sufﬁciently large n.\\nIn general, we expect an algorithm with a smaller leading term to be a better algorithm for\\nlarge problems, but for smaller problems, there may be a crossover point where another\\nalgorithm is better. The location of the crossover point depends on the details of the algo-\\nrithms, the inputs, and the hardware, so it is usually ignored for purposes of algorithmic\\nanalysis. But that doesn’t mean you can forget about it.\\nIf two algorithms have the same leading order term, it is hard to say which is better; again,\\nthe answer depends on the details. So for algorithmic analysis, functions with the same\\nleading term are considered equivalent, even if they have different coefﬁcients.'),\n",

Analysis of Algorithms\\nB.2 Analysis of basic Python operations\\nMost arithmetic operations are constant time; multiplication usually takes longer than ad-\\ndition and subtraction, and division takes even longer, but these run times don’t depend\\non the magnitude of the operands. Very large integers are an exception; in that case the run\\ntime increases with the number of digits.\\nIndexing operations—reading or writing elements in a sequence or dictionary—are also\\nconstant time, regardless of the size of the data structure.\\nA for loop that traverses a sequence or dictionary is usually linear, as long as all of the\\noperations in the body of the loop are constant time. For example, adding up the elements\\nof a list is linear:\\ntotal = 0\\nfor x in t:\\ntotal += x\\nThe built-in function sum is also linear because it does the same thing, but it tends to be\\nfaster because it is a more efﬁcient implementation; in the language of algorithmic analysis,\\nit has a smaller leading coefﬁcient.\\nIf you use the same loop to “add” a list of strings, the run time is quadratic because string\\nconcatenation is linear.\\nThe string method join is usually faster because it is linear in the total length of the strings.\\nAs a rule of thumb, if the body of a loop is inO(na) then the whole loop is in O(na+1). The\\nexception is if you can show that the loop exits after a constant number of iterations. If a\\nloop runs k times regardless of n, then the loop is in O(na), even for large k.\\nMultiplying by k doesn’t change the order of growth, but neither does dividing. So if the\\nbody of a loop is in O(na) and it runs n/k times, the loop is in O(na+1), even for large k.\\nMost string and tuple operations are linear, except indexing and len , which are constant\\ntime. The built-in functions min and max are linear. The run-time of a slice operation is\\nproportional to the length of the output, but independent of the size of the input.\\nAll string methods are linear, but if the lengths of the strings are bounded by a constant—\\nfor example, operations on single characters—they are considered constant time.\\nMost list methods are linear, but there are some exceptions:\\n• Adding an element to the end of a list is constant time on average; when it runs\\nout of room it occasionally gets copied to a bigger location, but the total time for n\\noperations is O(n), so we say that the “amortized” time for one operation is O(1).\\n• Removing an element from the end of a list is constant time.\\n• Sorting is O(n log n).\\nMost dictionary operations and methods are constant time, but there are some exceptions:\\n• The run time of copy is proportional to the number of elements, but not the size of\\nthe elements (it copies references, not the elements themselves).'),\n",

In the worst case it has to traverse the entire\\ncollection, so the run time is linear.\\nThe in operator for sequences uses a linear search; so do string methods like find and\\ncount .\\nIf the elements of the sequence are in order, you can use a bisection search , which is\\nO(log n). Bisection search is similar to the algorithm you probably use to look a word\\nup in a dictionary (a real dictionary, not the data structure). Instead of starting at the be-\\nginning and checking each item in order, you start with the item in the middle and check\\nwhether the word you are looking for comes before or after. If it comes before, then you\\nsearch the ﬁrst half of the sequence. Otherwise you search the second half. Either way, you\\ncut the number of remaining items in half.\\nIf the sequence has 1,000,000 items, it will take about 20 steps to ﬁnd the word or conclude\\nthat it’s not there. So that’s about 50,000 times faster than a linear search.'),\n",

Write a function called bisection that takes a sorted list and a target value and\\nreturns the index of the value in the list, if it’s there, orNone if it’s not.\\nOr you could read the documentation of the bisect module and use that!\\nBisection search can be much faster than linear search, but it requires the sequence to be in\\norder, which might require extra work.\\nThere is another data structure, called a hashtable that is even faster—it can do a search\\nin constant time—and it doesn’t require the items to be sorted. Python dictionaries are\\nimplemented using hashtables, which is why most dictionary operations, including the in\\noperator, are constant time.\\nB.4 Hashtables\\nTo explain how hashtables work and why their performance is so good, I start with a simple\\nimplementation of a map and gradually improve it until it’s a hashtable.\\nI use Python to demonstrate these implementations, but in real life you wouldn’t write\\ncode like this in Python; you would just use a dictionary! So for the rest of this chapter, you\\nhave to imagine that dictionaries don’t exist and you want to implement a data structure\\nthat maps from keys to values. The operations you have to implement are:\\nadd(k, v) : Add a new item that maps from key k to value v . With a Python dictionary, d ,\\nthis operation is written d[k] = v .\\nget(target) : Look up and return the value that corresponds to keytarget . With a Python\\ndictionary, d , this operation is written d[target] or d.get(target) .\\nFor now, I assume that each key only appears once. The simplest implementation of this\\ninterface uses a list of tuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair.\\nclass LinearMap(object):\\ndef __init__(self):\\nself.items = []\\ndef add(self, k, v):\\nself.items.append((k, v))\\ndef get(self, k):\\nfor key, val in self.items:\\nif key == k:\\nreturn val\\nraise KeyError\\nadd appends a key-value tuple to the list of items, which takes constant time.\\nget uses a for loop to search the list: if it ﬁnds the target key it returns the corresponding\\nvalue; otherwise it raises a KeyError . So get is linear.\\nAn alternative is to keep the list sorted by key. Then get could use a bisection search,\\nwhich is O(log n). But inserting a new item in the middle of a list is linear, so this might'),\n",

There are other data structures (see http://en.wikipedia.org/\\nwiki/Red- black_tree ) that can implement add and get in log time, but that’s still not as\\ngood as constant time, so let’s move on.\\nOne way to improve LinearMap is to break the list of key-value pairs into smaller lists.\\nHere’s an implementation called BetterMap , which is a list of 100 LinearMaps. As we’ll\\nsee in a second, the order of growth for get is still linear, but BetterMap is a step on the\\npath toward hashtables:\\nclass BetterMap(object):\\ndef __init__(self, n=100):\\nself.maps = []\\nfor i in range(n):\\nself.maps.append(LinearMap())\\ndef find_map(self, k):\\nindex = hash(k) % len(self.maps)\\nreturn self.maps[index]\\ndef add(self, k, v):\\nm = self.find_map(k)\\nm.add(k, v)\\ndef get(self, k):\\nm = self.find_map(k)\\nreturn m.get(k)\\n__init__ makes a list of n LinearMap s.\\nfind_map is used by add and get to ﬁgure out which map to put the new item in, or which\\nmap to search.\\nfind_map uses the built-in functionhash , which takes almost any Python object and returns\\nan integer. A limitation of this implementation is that it only works with hashable keys.\\nMutable types like lists and dictionaries are unhashable.\\nHashable objects that are considered equal return the same hash value, but the converse is\\nnot necessarily true: two different objects can return the same hash value.\\nfind_map uses the modulus operator to wrap the hash values into the range from 0 to\\nlen(self.maps) , so the result is a legal index into the list. Of course, this means that many\\ndifferent hash values will wrap onto the same index. But if the hash function spreads things\\nout pretty evenly (which is what hash functions are designed to do), then we expectn/100\\nitems per LinearMap.\\nSince the run time of LinearMap.get is proportional to the number of items, we expect\\nBetterMap to be about 100 times faster than LinearMap. The order of growth is still linear,\\nbut the leading coefﬁcient is smaller. That’s nice, but still not as good as a hashtable.\\nHere (ﬁnally) is the crucial idea that makes hashtables fast: if you can keep the maximum\\nlength of the LinearMaps bounded, LinearMap.get is constant time. All you have to do is\\nkeep track of the number of items and when the number of items per LinearMap exceeds\\na threshold, resize the hashtable by adding more LinearMaps.\\nHere is an implementation of a hashtable:'),\n",

At that time, Python was a much smaller language and it came\\nwith a useful set of batteries in its standard library. It was something that\\ncould mostly fit your brain. The Essential Reference reflected that era. It\\nwas meant to be a small book that you could take with you to write some\\nPython code on a desert island or inside a secret vault. Over three\\nsubsequent revisions, the Essential Reference more-or-less evolved with\\nthis vision of being a compact, but complete language reference—because\\nif you were going to code Python on vacation, why wouldn’t you want to\\nuse all of it?\\nToday, more than a decade has passed since the publication of the last\\nedition and the Python world is much different. No longer a niche language,\\nPython has grown to become one of the most popular programming\\nlanguages in the world. Python programmers also have a wealth of\\ninformation at their fingertips in the form of advanced editors, IDEs,\\nnotebooks, web pages, and more. In fact, there’s probably little need to\\nconsult a \"reference book\" when almost any reference material you might\\nwant can be conjured to appear before your very eyes with the touch of a\\nfew keys.\\nIf anything, the ease of information retrieval and the \"bigness\" of the\\nPython universe presents a different kind of challenge. If you’re just trying\\nto learn or starting to solve a new problem, it can be a bit overwhelming to\\nknow where to begin. It can also be di˚cult to separate the features of\\nvarious tools from the core language itself. These kinds of problems are the\\nfoundation for this book.\\nPython Distilled is a book about programming in Python. However, rather\\nthan tring to document absolutely \"everything\" that’s possible or has been\\npreviously done in Python, the focus is on presenting a modern, yet curated\\n(or distilled) core of the language. Much of this has been informed by my\\nyears of teaching Python to scientists, engineers, and software\\nprofessionals. However, it’s also a product of writing various software'),\n",

Managing all of this is a complex topic that continues\\nto evolve. There are also many conflicting opinions about what constitutes\\n\"best practice.\" However, there are a few essential facets to it that you\\nshould know.\\nFirst, it is standard practice to organize large code bases into a package\\nstructure as described in the last section (e.g., directories of .py files that\\ninclude the special __init__.py file). When doing this, pick a unique\\npackage name for the top-level directory name. The primary purpose of the\\npackage directory is to manage import statements and the namespace of\\nmodules used while programming.

This additional material usually\\nlives in a separate set of directories than the package containing your source\\ncode. Thus, it is common to create an enclosing top-level directory for your\\nproject and to put all of your work under that. For example, a fairly typical\\nproject organization might look something like this:\\ntutorial-project/ \\n    tutorial/ \\n        __init__.py \\n        readport.py \\n        pcost.py \\n        stack.py \\n        ... \\n    tests/ \\n        test_stack.py \\n        test_pcost.py \\n        ... \\n    examples/ \\n        sample.py \\n        ... \\n    doc/'),\n",

You may want to depend on some\\nof these packages in your own code. To install a third party package, you\\ntypically use a command such as pip like this:\\nbash % python3 -m pip install somepackage\\nInstalled packages are placed into a special site-packages directory that\\nyou can find if you inspect the value of sys.path. For example, on a Unix\\nmachine, packages might be placed in a directory such as\\n/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages. If you are ever left wondering\\nwhere a package is coming from, you can also inspect the __file__ attribute\\nof a package after importing it in the interpreter:\\n>>> import pandas \\n>>> pandas.__file__ \\n\\'/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pandas/__init__.py\\' \\n>>>\\nOne potential problem with installing a package is that you might not have\\npermission to change the locally installed version of Python. Even if you\\nhad permission, it still might not be a good idea (for example, many\\nsystems already have Python installed for use by various system utilities.\\nAltering the installation of that version of Python is often a bad idea).\\nTo make a sandbox where you can install packages and work without\\nworrying about breaking anything, you can create a so-called \"virtual\\nenvironment\" by typing a command like this:\\nbash % python3 -m venv myproject'),\n",

The operations in Table 5 can be applied to any iterable object s:\\nTable 5: Operations on Iterables\\nThe most essential operation on an iterable is the for-loop. This is how you\\niterate through the values, one by one. All of the other operations build\\nupon this.\\nThe x in s operator tests to see whether the object x appears as one of the\\nitems produced by the iterable s and returns True or False. The x not in s\\noperator is the same as evaluating not (x in s). For strings, the in and not\\nin operators accept subtrings. For example, 'hello' in 'hello world'\\nproduces True. It is important to note that the in operator does not support\\nwildcards or any kind of pattern matching.\\nAny object supporting iteration can have its values unpacked into a series of\\nlocations. For example:\\nitems = [ 3, 4, 5 ] \\nx, y, z = items       # x = 3, y = 4, z = 5\"),\n",

In fact,\\nany valid location that could appear on the left-hand-side of an equal sign is\\nacceptable. So, you could write code like this:\\nitems = [3, 4, 5] \\nd = { } \\nd[\\'x\\'], d[\\'y\\'], d[\\'z\\'] = items\\nWhen unpacking values into locations, the number of locations on the left\\nmust exactly match the number of items in the iterable on the right. For\\nnested data structures, you can match locations and data by following the\\nsame structural pattern. Consider this example of unpacking two nested 3-\\ntuples:\\ndatetime = ((5, 19, 2008), (10, 30, \"am\")) \\n(month, day, year), (hour, minute, am_pm) = datetime\\nSometimes, the _ variable is used to indicate a throw-away value when\\nunpacking. For example, if you only cared about the day and the hour, you\\ncould write the following:\\n(_, day, _), (hour, _, _) = datetime\\nIf the number of items being unpacked isn’t known, you can use an\\nextended form of unpacking by including a starred variable such as *extra\\nas shown in the following example:\\nitems = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] \\na, b, *extra = items     # a = 1, b = 2, extra = [3,4,5]\\n*extra, a, b             # extra = [1,2,3], a = 4, b = 5 \\na, *extra, b             # a = 1, extra = [2,3,4], b = 5\\nIn this example, *extra receives all of the extra items. It is always a list. At\\nmost, only one starred variable can be used when unpacking a single\\niterable. However, multiple starred variables could be used when unpacking\\nmore complex data structures involving different iterables. For example:\\ndatetime = ((5, 19, 2008), (10, 30, \"am\"))'),\n",

However, there are a few rules of thumb that make it easier.\\nThe first rule is to not catch exceptions that can’t be directly handled at that\\nspecific location in the code. Consider a function like this:\\ndef read_data(filename): \\n    with open(filename, 'rt') as file: \\n         rows = [] \\n         for line in file: \\n             row = line.split() \\n             rows.append((row[0], int(row[1]), float(row[2])) \\n    return rows\\nSuppose that the open() function fails due to a bad filename. Is this an error\\nthat should be caught with a try-except statement in this function?\\nProbably not. If the caller gives a bad filename, there is no sensible way to\\nrecover (there is no file to open, no data to read, and nothing else that’s\\npossible). It’s better to let the operation fail and report an exception back to\\nthe caller. Avoiding an error check in read_data() doesn’t mean that the\\nexception would never be handled anywhere—it just means that it’s not the\\nrole of read_data() to do it. Perhaps the code that prompted a user for a\\nfilename would check for it.\\nThis advice might seem highly contrary to the experience of programmers\\nwho are accustomed to languages that rely upon special error codes or\\nwrapped result types. In those languages, great care is made to make sure\\nyou always check return codes for errors on all operations. You don’t do\\nthis in Python. If an operation can fail and there’s nothing you can do to\\nrecover, it’s better to just let it fail. The exception will propagate to upper\\nlevels of the program where it is usually the responsibility of some other\\ncode to handle it.\\nOn the other hand, a function might be able to recover from bad data. For\\nexample:\\ndef read_data(filename): \\n    with open(filename, 'rt') as file: \\n         rows = [] \\n         for line in file: \\n             row = line.split()\"),\n",

There are a variety of\\nbuilt-in types such as numbers, strings, lists, sets, and dictionaries. In\\naddition, you can make your own types using classes. This chapter\\ndescribes the underlying Python object model and mechanisms that make\\nall objects work. Particular attention is given to the \"protocols\" that define\\nthe core behavior of various objects.\\nEssential Concepts\\nEvery piece of data stored in a program is an object. Each object has an\\nidentity, a type (also known as its class), and a value. For example, when\\nyou write a = 42, an integer object is created with the value of 42. The\\nidentity of the object is a number representing its location in memory. a is a\\nlabel that refers to this specific location although the label is not part of the\\nobject itself.\\nThe type of an object, also known as the object’s class, defines the object’s\\ninternal data representation as well as supported methods. When an object\\nof a particular type is created, that object is called an \"instance\" of that type.\\nAfter an instance is created, its identity does not change. If an object’s value\\ncan be modified, the object is said to be mutable. If the value cannot be\\nmodified, the object is said to be immutable. An object that holds references\\nto other objects is said to be a container.\\nObjects are characterized by their attributes. An attribute is a value\\nassociated with an object that is accessed using the dot (.) operator. An\\nattribute might be a simple data value such as a number. However, an\\nattribute could also be a function that is invoked to carry out some\\noperation. Such functions are said to be methods. The following example\\nillustrates access to attributes:\\na = 34                # Create an integer \\nn = a.numerator       # Get the numerator (an attribute)'),\n",

For\\nexample:\\nc = a + 10            # c = 13 + 4j \\nd = b + [4, 5]        # d = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\\nAlthough operators use a different syntax, they are ultimately mapped to\\nmethods. For example, writing a + 10 executes a method a.__add__(10).\\nObject Identity and Type\\nThe built-in function id() returns the identity of an object. The identity is\\nan integer that usually corresponds to the object’s location in memory. The\\nis and is not operators compare the identity of two objects. type() returns\\nthe type of an object. Here’s an example of different ways you might\\ncompare two objects:\\n# Compare two objects\\ndef compare(a, b): \\n    if a is b: \\n        print('same object') \\n    if a == b: \\n        print('same value') \\n    if type(a) is type(b): \\n        print('same type')\\nHere is an example of how this function works:\\n>>> a = [1, 2, 3] \\n>>> b = [1, 2, 3] \\n>>> compare(a, a) \\nsame object \\nsame value \\nsame type \\n>>> compare(a, b) \\nsame value\"),\n",

This object\\nis uniquely defined and is always the same for all instances of a given type.\\nClasses usually have names (e.g., list, int, dict, etc.) that can be used to\\ncreate instances, perform type-checking, and for type hinting. For example:\\nitems = list() \\n \\nif isinstance(items, list): \\n    items.append(item) \\ndef removeall(items: list, item) -> list: \\n    return [i for i in items if i != item]\\nA \"subtype\" is a type defined by inheritance. It carries all of the features of\\nthe original type, plus additional and/or redefined methods. Inheritance is\\ndiscussed in more detail in Chapter 7, but here is an example of defining a\\nsubtype of list with a new method added to it.\\nclass mylist(list): \\n    def removeall(self, val): \\n        return [i for i in self if i != val] \\n \\n# Example \\nitems = mylist([5, 8, 2, 7, 2, 13, 9]) \\nx = items.removeall(2) \\nprint(x)      # [5, 8, 7, 13, 9]\\nThe isinstance(instance, type) function is the preferred way to check a\\nvalue against a type because it is aware of subtypes. It can also check\\nagainst many possible types. For example:\\nif isinstance(items, (list, tuple)): \\n    maxval = max(items)\\nAlthough type checks can be added to a program, type checking is often not\\nas useful as you might imagine. For one, excessive checking impacts\\nperformance. Second, programs don’t always define objects that neatly fit'),\n",

All objects\\nare reference-counted. An object’s reference count is increased whenever\\nit’s assigned to a new name or placed in a container such as a list, tuple, or\\ndictionary, as shown here:\\na = 37       # Creates an object with value 37 \\nb = a        # Increases reference count on 37 \\nc = [] \\nc.append(b)  # Increases reference count on 37\\nThis example creates a single object containing the value 37. a is a name\\nthat initially refers to the newly created object. When b is assigned a, b\\nbecomes a new name for the same object, and the object’s reference count\\nincreases. Likewise, when you place b into a list, the object’s reference\\ncount increases once again. Throughout the example, only one object\\ncorresponds to 37. All other operations are creating references to that\\nobject.\\nAn object’s reference count is decreased by the del statement or whenever a\\nreference goes out of scope (or is reassigned). Here’s an example:\\ndel a      # Decrease reference count of 37 \\nb = 42     # Decrease reference count of 37 \\nc[0] = 2.0 # Decrease reference count of 37\\nThe current reference count of an object can be obtained using the\\nsys.getrefcount() function. For example:\\n>>> a = 37 \\n>>> import sys \\n>>> sys.getrefcount(a)'),\n",

For\\nimmutable data such as numbers and strings, the interpreter aggressively\\nshares objects between different parts of the program in order to conserve\\nmemory. You just don’t notice because the objects are immutable.\\nWhen an object’s reference count reaches zero, it is garbage-collected.\\nHowever, in some cases a circular dependency may exist among a\\ncollection of objects that are no longer in use. Here’s an example:\\na = { } \\nb = { } \\na[\\'b\\'] = b      # a contains reference to b \\nb[\\'a\\'] = a      # b contains reference to a\\ndel a \\ndel b\\nIn this example, the del statements decrease the reference count of a and b\\nand destroys the names used to refer to the underlying objects. However,\\nbecause each object contains a reference to the other, the reference count\\ndoesn’t drop to zero and the objects remain allocated. Ultimately, the\\ninterpreter won’t leak memory, but the destruction of the objects is delayed\\nuntil a cycle detector executes to find and delete the inaccessible objects.\\nThe cycle-detection algorithm runs periodically as the interpreter allocates\\nmore and more memory during execution. The exact behavior can be fine-\\ntuned and controlled using functions in the gc standard library module (see\\nURL). The gc.collect() function can be used to immediately invoke the\\ncyclic garbage collector.\\nIn most programs, garbage collection is something that simply \"happens\"\\nwithout you having to think much about it. However, there are certain\\nsituations where manually deleting objects might make sense. One such\\nscenario arises when working with gigantic data structures.

Here’s an example:\\ndef square(items): \\n    for i, x in enumerate(items): \\n        items[i] = x * x    # Modify items in-place \\n \\na = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] \\nsquare(a)      # Changes a to [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\\nFunctions that mutate their input values or change the state of other parts of\\nthe program behind the scenes like this are said to have \"side effects.\" As a\\ngeneral rule, side effects are best avoided as they can become a source of\\nsubtle programming errors as programs grow in size and complexity (for\\nexample, it may not be obvious from reading a function call if a function\\nhas side-effects or not). Such functions also interact poorly with programs\\ninvolving threads and concurrency since side-effects typically need to be\\nprotected by locks.\\nIt’s also important to make a distinction between modifying an object and\\nreassigning a variable name. For example, consider this function:\\ndef sum_squares(items): \\n    items = [x*x for x in items]    # Reassign \"items\" name \\n    return sum(items) \\n \\na = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] \\nresult = sum_squares(a) \\nprint(a)        # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]    (Unchanged)\\nIn this example, it appears as if the sum_squares() function might be\\noverwriting the passed items variable. Yes, the local items label is\\nreassigned to a new value. However, the original input value (a) is\\nunchanged by that operation. Instead, the local variable name items is\\nbound to a completely different object—the result of the internal list'),\n",

Looking up an undefined name of a free variable in the global\\nenvironment results in a NameError exception. Looking up a local variable\\nthat hasn’t been assigned a value yet results in an UnboundLocalError\\nexception. This latter error is often a result of control flow bugs.

With partial(),\\nthe arguments are evaluated and bound at the time the partial function is\\nfirst defined.

That said, there are still some practical\\napplications.\\nLike generators, an enhanced generator can be used to implement different\\nkinds of evaluation and control-flow. One such example is the\\n@contextmanager decorator found in the contextlib module. For example:\\nfrom contextlib import contextmanager\\n@contextmanager\\ndef manager(): \\n    print(\"Entering\") \\n    try: \\n         yield \\'somevalue\\' \\n    except Exception as e: \\n         print(\"An error occurred\", e) \\n    finally: \\n         print(\"Leaving\")\\nHere, a generator is being used to glue together the two-halves of a context\\nmanager.

You’ll eventually find it if you just keep on\\ndigging the hole of technical debt deep enough.\\nFinal Words: A Brief History of Generators and\\nLooking Forward\\nGenerators are one of Python’s more interesting success stories. However,\\nthey are part of a greater story concerning iteration. Iteration is one of the\\nmost common programming tasks of all. In early versions of Python,\\niteration was implemented via sequence indexing and the __getitem__()\\nmethod. This later evolved into the current iteration protocol based on\\n__iter__() and __next__() methods. Generators appeared shortly thereafter\\nas a more convenient way to implement an iterator. In modern Python, there\\nis almost no reason to ever implement an iterator using anything other than\\na generator. Even on iterable objects that you might define yourself, the\\n__iter__() method itself is conveniently implemented in this way.\\nIn later versions of Python, generators took on a new role as they evolved\\n\"enhanced\" features related to coroutines (e.g., the send() and throw()\\nmethods). These were no longer related purely to iteration, but opened up\\npossibilities for using generators in other contexts. Most notably, this\\nformed the basis of many so-called \"async\" frameworks used for network\\nprogramming and concurrency. However, as asynchronous programming\\nhas evolved, most of this has transformed into later features related to the\\nasync/await syntax. Thus, it’s not so common to see generator functions\\nused outside of the context of iteration— their original purpose. In fact, if\\nyou find yourself defining a generator function and you’re NOT performing\\niteration, you should probably stop for a moment to reconsider your\\napproach. There may be a better or more modern way to accomplish what\\nyou’re doing.'),\n",

If you make a lookup such as obj.name, it will work\\non any obj whatsoever that happens to have a name attribute. This behavior\\nis sometimes referred to as duck typing in reference to the adage \"if it looks\\nlike, quacks like, and walks like a duck, then it’s a duck.\"\\nPython programmers often write programs that rely on this behavior. For\\nexample, if you want to make a customized version of an existing object,\\nyou can either inherit from it or you can create a completely new object that\\nlooks and acts like it, but is otherwise unrelated.

A common naming convention for such methods is to include the\\nword from_ as a prefix such as from_timestamp(). You will see this naming\\nconvention used to indicate class methods throughout the standard library\\nand in third party packages. For example, dictionaries have a class method\\nfor creating a pre-initialized dictionary from a set of keys:\\n>>> dict.from_keys(['a','b','c'], 0) \\n{'a': 0, 'b': 0, 'c': 0} \\n>>>\\nOne caution about class methods is that Python does not manage the\\nmethods in a separate namespace than the instance methods. As a result,\\nthey can still be invoked on an instance. For example:\\nd = Date(1967,4,9) \\nb = d.today()          # Calls Date.now(Date)\\nThis is potentially quite confusing because a call to d.today() doesn’t really\\nhave anything to do with the instance d. Yet, you might see today() listed as\\na valid method on instances in your IDE and in help.\\nStatic Methods\\nSometimes a class is merely used as a namespace for functions declared as\\nstatic methods using @staticmethod. Unlike a normal method or\\nclassmethod, a staticmethod does not take an extra self or cls argument. A\\nstatic method is just a ordinary function that happens to be defined inside a\\nclass. For example:\\nclass Ops: \\n    @staticmethod \\n    def add(x, y): \\n        return x + y \\n \\n    @staticmethod \\n    def sub(x, y): \\n        return x - y\"),\n",

The dynamic nature of Python\\nrenders a lot of these patterns obsolete or simply unnecessary (or as overkill\\nif used).\\nThat said, there are a few overarching principles of writing \"good\\nsoftware.\" For example, striving to code that is debuggable, testable, and\\nextensible.

For example, rather\\nthan trying to implement some exotic data traversal pattern from a Java\\nprogramming book, a Python programmer would probably implement it\\nwith a generator function feeding a for-loop.

This is often\\nundesirable in object-oriented applications because of a desire to hide or\\nencapsulate internal implementation details.\\nTo address this problem, Python relies on naming conventions as a means\\nfor signaling intended usage. One convention is to use names that start with\\na single leading underscore (_) to indicate internal implementation. For\\nexample, here’s a version of the Account class where the balance has been\\nturned into a \"private\" attribute:\\nclass Account: \\n    def __init__(self, owner, balance): \\n        self.owner = owner \\n        self._balance = balance \\n \\n    def __repr__(self): \\n        return f\\'Account({self.owner!r}, {self._balance!r})\\' \\n \\n    def deposit(self, amount): \\n        self._balance += amount \\n \\n    def withdraw(self, amount): \\n        self._balance -= amount'),\n",

Specifically,\\nwhenever you search for an attribute on an instance or class, each class on\\nthe MRO is checked in the order listed. The search stops when the first\\nmatch is made. Note: the object class is listed in the MRO because all\\nclasses inherit from object whether or not it’s listed as a parent.\\nTo support multiple inheritance, Python implements what’s known as\\n\"cooperative multiple inheritance.\" With cooperative inheritance, all of the\\nclasses are placed on the MRO list according to two primary ordering rules.\\nThe first rule states that a child class must always be checked before any of\\nits parents. The second rule states that if a class has multiple parents, those\\nparents must be checked in the same order as they’re written in the\\ninheritance list of the child. For the most part, these rules produce an MRO\\nthat \"makes sense.\" However, the precise algorithm that orders the classes is\\nactually quite complex and not based on any sort of \"simple\" algorithm\\nsuch as depth-first or breadth-first search.

One issue with mixins is that they are\\noptional and often mixed together in unpredictable orders.

If you must define __del__(), keep it simple.\\nWeak References\\nSometimes objects are kept alive when you’d much rather see them die. In\\nan earlier example, a Date class was shown with internal caching of\\ninstances. One problem with this implementation is that there is no way for\\nan instance to ever be removed from the cache. As such, the cache will\\ngrow larger and larger over time.\\nOne way to fix this problem is to create a weak reference using the weakref\\nmodule. A weak reference is a way of creating a reference to an object\\nwithout increasing its reference count. To work with a weak reference, you\\nhave to add an extra bit of code to check if the object being referred to still\\nexists. Here’s an example of how you create a weakref:\\n>>> a = Account('Guido', 1000.0) \\n>>> import weakref \\n>>> a_ref = weakref.ref(a) \\n>>> a_ref \\n<weakref at 0x104617188; to 'Account' at 0x1046105c0> \\n>>>\\nUnlike a normal reference, a weak reference allows the original object to\\ndie. For example:\\n>>> del a \\n>>> a_ref \\n<weakref at 0x104617188; dead> \\n>>>\"),\n",

The __bases__ attribute is only\\ninformational. The actual runtime implementation of inheritance uses the\\n__mro__ attribute which is a tuple of all parent classes listed in search order.\\nThis underlying structure is the basis for all of the operations that get, set,\\nand delete the attributes of instances.\\nWhenever an attribute is set using obj.name = value, the special method\\nobj.__setattr__('name', value) is invoked. If an attribute is deleted using\\ndel obj.name, the special method obj.__delattr__('name') is invoked. The\\ndefault behavior of these methods is to modify or remove values from the\\nlocal __dict__ of obj unless the requested attribute happens to correspond\\nto a property or descriptor. In that case, the set and delete operation will be\\ncarried out by the set and delete functions associated with the property.\\nFor attribute lookup such as obj.name, the special method\\nobj.__getattribute__('name') is invoked. This method carries out the\\nsearch process for finding the attribute, which normally includes checking\\nfor properties, looking in the local __dict__ attribute, checking the class\\ndictionary, and searching the MRO.

If you don’t use super(), you will have to take care of these\\ndetails yourself.\\nProxies, Wrappers, and Delegation\\nSometimes classes implement a wrapper layer around another object to\\ncreate a kind of proxy object. A proxy is an object exposes the same\\ninterface as another object, but for various reasons, isn’t related to the\\noriginal object via inheritance. This is somewhat different than composition\\nwhere an entirely new object is created from other objects, but the new\\nobject has its own unique set of methods and attributes.\\nThere are many real-world examples where this might arise. For example,\\nin distributed computing, the actual implementation of an object might live\\non a remote server in the cloud. Clients that interact with that server might\\nuse a proxy that looks like the object on the server, but which is actually\\ndelegating all of its method calls into network messages behind the scenes.\\nA common implementation technique for proxies involves the use of the\\n__getattr__() method.

Its\\nmutability makes it suitable for building up groups of bytes in a more\\nincremental manner as often happens when assembling data from\\nfragments. The following example illustrates a few features of bytes and\\nbytearray:\\n# Specify a bytes literal (note: b' prefix) \\na = b'hello' \\n \\n# Specify bytes from a list of integers \\nb = bytes([0x68, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f]) \\n \\n# Create and populate a bytearray from parts \\nc = bytearray() \\nc.extend(b'world')   # d = 'world' \\nc.append(0x21)       # d = 'world!'\"),\n",

For example, converting a floating point\\nnumber to a string with a given width and precision. To format a single\\nvalue, you can use the format() function:\\nx = 123.456 \\nformat(x, \\'0.2f\\')       # \\'123.46\\' \\nformat(x, \\'10.4f\\')      # \\'  123.4560\\' \\nformat(x, \\'<*10.2f\\')    # \\'123.46****\\'\\nThe second argument to format() is a format specifier. The general format\\nof the specifier is usually [[fill[align]][sign][0][width][,]\\n[.precision][type] where each part enclosed in [] is optional. The width\\nspecifier specifies the minimum field width to use, and the align specifier is\\none of <, >, or ˆ for left, right, and centered alignment within the field. An\\noptional fill character fill is used to pad the space. For example:'),\n",

You give it the\\nname of the file you want to open along with a file mode.

However, there are a number of special cases\\nand more esoteric features of open() worth knowing. The next few sections\\ndiscuss open() and file I/O in more detail.\\nFilenames\\nTo open a file, you need to give open() the name of the file. The name can\\neither be a fully specified absolute pathname such as\\n\\'/Users/guido/Desktop/files/old/data.csv\\' or a relative filename such as\\n\\'data.csv\\' or \\'..\\\\old\\\\data.csv\\'. For relative filenames, the file location is\\ndetermined according to the value of the current working directory as\\nreturned by os.getcwd(). The current working directory can be changed\\nusing os.chdir(newdir).\\nThe name itself can be encoded in a number of forms. If it’s a text string,\\nthe name is interpreted according to the text encoding returned by\\nsys.getfilesystemencoding() before being passed to the host operating\\nsystem. If the filename is a byte string, the filename is left unencoded and is\\npassed \"as is.\" This latter option may be useful if you’re writing programs\\nthat must handle the possibility of degenerate or miscoded filenames—\\ninstead of passing the filename as text, you can pass the raw binary\\nrepresentation of the name. This might seem like an obscure edge case, but\\nPython is commonly used to write system-level scripts that manipulate the\\nfilesystem. Abuse of the filesystem is a common technique used by hackers\\nto either hide their tracks or to break system tools.\\nIn addition to text and bytes, any object that implements the special method\\n__fspath__() can be used as a name. The __fspath__() method must return\\na text or bytes object correponding to the actual name. This is the\\nmechanism that makes standard library modules such as pathlib work. For\\nexample:\\n>>> from pathlib import Path \\n>>> p = Path(\\'Data/portfolio.csv\\')'),\n",

This\\nrequires that the \"file\" is already open on the system in some way. Perhaps\\nit corresponds to a network socket, a pipe, or some other system resource\\nthat exposes a file descriptor. Here is an example of opening a file directly\\nwith the os module and then turning it into a proper file object:\\n>>> import os \\n>>> fd = os.open(\\'/etc/passwd\\', os.O_RDONLY) \\n>>> fd \\n3 \\n>>> file = open(fd, \\'rt\\') \\n>>> file \\n<_io.TextIOWrapper name=3 mode=\\'rt\\' encoding=\\'UTF-8\\'> \\n>>> data = file.read() \\n>>>\\nWhen opening an existing file descriptor like this, the close() method of\\nthe returned file will also close the underlying descriptor as well.

For this mode, a FileExistsError exception is raised if the\\nfile already exists.\\nPython makes a strict distinction between text and binary data. To specify\\nthe kind of data, you append a 't' or a 'b' to the file mode. For example, a\\nfile mode of 'rt' opens a file for reading in text mode and 'rb' opens a file\\nfor reading in binary mode. The mode determines the kind of data returned\\nby file-related methods such as f.read(). In text-mode, strings are returned.\\nIn binary mode, bytes are returned.\\nBinary files can be opened for in-place updates by supplying a plus (+)\\ncharacter, such as 'rb+' or 'wb+'. When a file is opened for update, you can\\nperform both input and output, as long as all output operations flush their\\ndata before any subsequent input operations. If a file is opened using 'wb+'\\nmode, its length is first truncated to zero. A common use of update mode is\\nto provide random read/write access to file contents in combination with\\nseek operations.\\nI/O Buffering\\nBy default, files are opened with I/O buffering enabled. With I/O buffering,\\nI/O operations are performed in larger chunks to avoid excessive system\\ncalls. For example, write operations would start filling an internal memory\\nbuffer and output would only actually occur when the buffer filled up. This\\nbehavior can be changed by giving a buffering argument to open(). For\\nexample:\\n# Open a binary-mode file with no I/O buffering \\n \\nwith open('data.bin', 'wb', buffering=0) as file: \\n    file.write(data) \\n    ...\\nA value of 0 specifies unbuffered I/O and is only valid for binary mode\\nfiles. A value of 1 specifies line-buffering and is usually only meaningful\\nfor text-mode files. Any other positive value indicates the buffer size to use\\n(in bytes). If no buffering value is specified, the default behavior depends\\nthe kind of file.

Thus, a\\nsequence of objects can be saved by issuing a series of dump() operations\\none after the other. To restore these objects, simply use a similar sequence\\nof load() operations.\\nFor network programming, it is common to use pickle to create byte-\\nencoded messages. To do that, use dumps() and loads() instead. Instead of'),\n",

However, certain kinds of objects can’t be pickled. These\\ntend to be objects that incorporate runtime state such as open files, threads,\\nclosures, generators, etc. To handle these tricky edge cases, a class can\\ndefine the special methods __getstate__() and __setstate__().\\nThe __getstate__() method, if defined, will be called to create a value\\nrepresenting the state of an object. The value returned by __getstate__() is\\ntypically a string, tuple, list, or dictionary. The __setstate__() method\\nreceives this value during unpickling and should restore the state of an\\nobject from it.\\nWhen encoding an object, pickle does not include the underlying source\\ncode itself. Instead, it encodes a name reference to the defining class. When\\nun-pickling, this name is used to perform a source-code lookup on the\\nsystem. It is critical that the recipient of a pickle have the proper source\\ncode already installed for unpickling to work. It is also critical to emphasize\\nthat pickle is inherently insecure—unpickling untrusted data is a known\\nvector for remote code execution. Thus, pickle should only be used if you\\ncan completely secure the runtime environment.\\nBlocking Operations and Concurrency\\nA fundamental aspect of I/O is the concept of \"blocking.\" By its very\\nnature, I/O is connected to the real world. It often involves waiting for input\\nor devices to be ready. For example, consider code that reads data on the\\nnetwork might perform a receive operation on a socket like this:\\ndata = sock.recv(8192)'),\n",

Only messages at that level or greater severity are reported. Logging\\nprovides a large number of configuration options, mostly related to the\\nback-end handling of the log messages. Knowing about that is usually not\\nnecessary when writing application code—you use debug(), info(),\\nwarning() and similar methods on some given Logger instance. Any special\\nconfiguration takes place during program startup in a special location (i.e.,\\nin a main() function or main code block).'),\n",

Given its\\npopularity, Python is able to work with literally any data format, encoding,\\nor document structure that’s in use. Although the standard library might not\\nsupport it, you can almost certainly find a third-party module to solve the\\nproblem for you.\\nIn thinking about the \"big picture\", it may be more useful to think about the\\nedges of your application. At the outer boundary between your program and\\nreality, it’s common to encounter issues related to data encoding. This is\\nespecially true for textual data and Unicode. Much of the complexity in\\nPython’s I/O handling is precisely aimed at this specific problem (i.e.,\\nsupporting different encoding, error handling policies, etc.). It’s also critical\\nto keep in mind that textual data and binary data are strictly separated into\\ndifferent objects. Thus, knowing what you’re working with helps in\\nunderstanding the big picture.\\nA secondary consideration in I/O is the overall evaluation model. Python\\ncode is currently separated into two worlds—normal synchronous code and\\nasynchronous code as is usually associated with the asyncio module (as\\ncharacterized by the use of async functions and the async/await syntax).\\nOften hyped, asynchronous code almost always requires the use of\\ndedicated libraries that are able to operate in that environment. This, in turn,\\nusually forces your hand on writing your application code in the \"async\"\\nstyle as well. Honestly, you should probably avoid asynchronous coding'),\n",
